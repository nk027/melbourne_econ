DESCRIPTION:Title: How computational complexity can restore general equili
 brium in markets with indivisible goods\n\nAbstract: We study market equil
 ibrium in settings with indivisible goods and tight budget constraints\, w
 here a traditional Walrasian Equilibrium (WE) may fail to exist. We introd
 uce the Complexity Compensating Equilibrium (CCE)\, in which prices endoge
 nously render the budget problem computationally difficult. Complexity ind
 uces heterogeneous demands even among agents with homogeneous preferences\
 , as individuals allocate varying levels of cognitive effort. We define th
 e equilibrium region as the set of price configurations that satisfy the n
 ecessary computational and economic conditions for equilibrium to exist. I
 n this region\, price configurations maximize the difficulty of the budget
  problem in addition to satisfying market clearing conditions. We evaluate
  the predictions of CCE through 10 sessions of a laboratory experiment. We
  find that trading prices consistently force the budget problem to the equ
 ilibrium region. Further supporting the CCE framework\, the equilibrium bu
 ndles of goods generate markedly different utility levels across agents. T
 his outcome contradicts a central feature of WE\, namely\, the equalizatio
 n of utilities. In a setting where it exists\, we reject WE on both prices
  and utilities. Yet prices and utilities continue to satisfy CCE requireme
 nts.\n\nContact: Mia Tam & Max Grossmann (GrossmannM@unimelb.edu.au\; mia.

 nsurance: Empirical Insights into Insurability Challenges\n\nAbstract:Cybe
 r insurance remains underdeveloped despite escalating organisational expos
 ure\, reflecting fundamental challenges to actuarial insurability criteria
  including data sparsity and inconsistency\, interdependencies of cyber lo
 sses\, and rapid technological change which drives uncertainty. This thesi
 s navigates these constraints through targeted analytical approaches. We e
 stablish reliable frequency measurement amid data constraints\, quantify a
 ttacker behaviour to reveal otherwise-hidden portfolio interdependencies\,
  and systematically extract information from underutilised text in severit
 y prediction. These contributions advance both cyber insurance practice an
 d provide methodological templates for emerging risks that challenge conve
 ntional actuarial assumptions.
