DESCRIPTION:Title: Inference on Linear Regressions with Two-Way Unobserved
  Heterogeneity (joint with Dennis Kristensen)\n\nAbstract: We develop a no
 vel estimation and inference procedure for the common parameters in linear
  panel data regression models with nonparametric two-way specification of 
 unobserved heterogeneity. Our procedure builds on two main ingredients: Fi
 rst\, we develop moment conditions for the common parameters that are Neym
 an orthogonal with respect to nonparametric component to reduce the effect
  of the first-step estimation of this. Second\, we develop a novel two-ste
 p estimator of the nonparametric component\, where the second step assumes
  that the nonparametric component is well-proxied by eigenfunctions estima
 ted in the first step. Together\, these ensure that the resulting estimato
 r of the common parameters is √NT–asymptotically normally distributed 
 so that valid inference on the linear parameters in the model can be perfo
 rmed. A numerical study shows that the proposed estimators perform well in
  finite samples.\n\nContact: David Harris (harris.d@unimelb.edu.au)
