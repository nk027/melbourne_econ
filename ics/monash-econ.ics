SUMMARY:[Joint Seminar with CDE] Berk Ozler (World Bank) The Effects of Voluntary Counseling and Testing for HIV on Risky Sexual Behavior and Human Capital Investments
LOCATION:BusEco-Meeting Room E_269 Clayton
DESCRIPTION:[Joint Seminar with Centre for Development Economics]\n\nThe Effects of Voluntary Counseling and Testing for HIV on Risky Sexual Behavior and Human Capital Investments\n\nSarah Baird\, George Washington University\nErick Gong\, Middlebury College\nCraig McIntosh\, University of California\, San Diego\nBerk Özler\, The World Bank\n\nAlthough HIV testing has been widely promoted as a means for individuals to learn their HIV-status and change their behavior\, there have been surprisingly few studies that credibly identify the causal effects of testing on behavior. This paper contributes to this developing literature by analyzing the impact of randomly assigned home based voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) on risky sexual behavior and human capital investments of young women in Malawi. While our results indicate that on average VCT has no impact on sexual behavior or educational outcomes\, this result masks differential impacts based on HIV status. We find little impact of a HIV-negative test\, but we find that HIV-positive tests lead to significant increases in Herpes SimplexVirus-2 rates and perceived HIV-risk. Underlying this result is the fact that a substantial proportion of those learning they are HIV-positive report there being no likelihood that they are infected with HIV after being tested. Deniers are much more likely to HSV-2 seroconvert during the study\, indicating that they are engaging in increased unprotected sex after learning they are HIV-positive. We also test the hypothesis that people non-HIV Life expectancy will affect individuals’ behavioral responses to HIV risk (Oster\, 2009) and find no evidence supporting it.

SUMMARY:[Joint Seminar with CDE] Sarah Baird (George Washington Univ) Worms at Work: Long-run Impacts of Child Health Gains
LOCATION:BusEco-Meeting Room E_269 Clayton
DESCRIPTION:Worms at Work: Long-run Impacts of Child Health Gains\n\nSarah Baird\, George Washington University\nJoan Hamory Hicks\, University of California\, Berkeley CEGA\nMichael Kremer\, Harvard University and NBER\nEdward Miguel\, University of California\, Berkeley and NBER\n\nAbstract: We use experimental variation in a Kenyan deworming program to calibrate the Grossman (1972) model\, in which health investments increase future endowments of healthy time\, and estimate the labor market and fiscal impacts of such investments. Ten years after the start of the program\, the treatment group has better self-reported health\, consume more meals\, spend more time in entrepreneurship\, and are more likely to grow cash crops. Kenyan women who participated in the program as girls have fewer miscarriages and reallocate labor time from agriculture to entrepreneurship. Men who participated as boys work 3.4 more hours each week\, and are more likely to hold manufacturing jobs with higher wage earnings. The deworming program generates positive externalities from reduced disease transmission. A calibration suggests that fully subsidizing deworming costs less than the additional net present value of government revenue it generates\, creating an “expenditure Laffer effect” in which government subsidies for health investments allow for reduced tax rates.  \n

DESCRIPTION:Title:               Reference-Dependent Preferences in Auctions: Theory and Experiment\n \nWhen:             February 8\, 12:15-1:30 pm\nWhere:            Menzies\, N802\nAbstract:         In this paper\, we provide experimental evidence for reference-dependent preferences in first-price auctions. We extend Lange and Ratan’s (2010) model of “anticipated loss aversion” to study bidding in auctions against pre-programmed computer bidders. In one treatment condition\, human bidders compete against “risk-neutral-Nash” computer rivals\; and in another they compete against “zero-profit” computer bidders. The payoffs are manipulated such that expected payoffs remain the same across these treatments. The model of “anticipated loss-aversion” predicts (i) overbidding with respect to the “risk-neutral-Nash” benchmark and (ii) a unique treatment effect. This treatment effect can’t be explained by risk-aversion or other behavioral models of bidding in auctions. We analyze the bidding data which supports that (i) bidders are “loss-averse” and (ii) supports the treatment effect. For plausible degrees of loss-aversion\, “loss-averse” bidders respond by bidding more aggressively in auctions against “zero-profit” computers.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:Munirul Nabin (Deakin University)\nTitle:Epidemic\, Matching in Labour Market and Segregation: Policy Implication\n\nWhen:March 1\, 12:15-1:30 pm\nWhere:Menzies\, N802\nAbstract:We incorporate diseases transmission dynamics in Pissarides’ (2000) matching model of labour market to analyse an individual firm’s hiring behaviour in the epidemic region. An individual firm\, operating in the epidemic region\, posts its vacancy which needs to be filled by a susceptible worker. An individual firm faces two types of costs in the epidemic region: (i) undertaking search for susceptible workers and (ii) loss of production if an individual firm’s vacancy remains unfilled. Once the firm finds a susceptible worker to match its vacancy\, the wage is determined by the Nash bargaining solution. In this set-up\, unlike Pissarides (2000)\, we find multiple steady states where (i) a lower wage rate is associated with low job creation (i.e.\, the labour market is very tight)\, and (ii) a higher wage rate is associated with high job creation (i.e.\, the labour market is less tight). Since the labour market will be extremely tight in the presence of high prevalence rate of infectious diseases and vice versa\, our result can be interpreted as a possible source of income segregation in the epidemic region\, which is evident in many countries. We then consider alternative policies to lower the high prevalence rate of the infectious disease in the epidemic region. To that end\, we consider two financing schemes alleviate the effect of the disease: (i) an exogenous externally-financed one and (ii) an endogenous self-financed one. We find that the externally financed might be more effective than the internally financed one\, as the latter may magnify the income segregation or may even lead to the destruction of the labour market altogether.

DESCRIPTION:Learning to Use Private Information: Reexamining the Asymmetric-Information Game in the Laboratory.\n\nhttp://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/a051201e-15ff-43f0-b682-fe886c3b93c3/AsyInfoExperiment1.pdf?MOD=AJPERES\n\nAbstract: This paper examines the two-stage asymmetric information game studied by Feltovich (1997\, 1999 and 2000) and compares it to a modified game in the laboratory. By tracking subjects' information acquisition\, I find evidence in support of a belief-based learning model. The maximum-likelihood estimations of subjects' learning behaviors using the EWA model (Camerer and Ho 1999) show that informed and uninformed players learn at different speeds\, and the informed group is more active in learning than its counterpart. In addition\, the estimations of EWA suggest that\, while the reduced belief-based model characterizes players' behaviors better than the reduced reinforcement model\, it slightly underperforms in prediction. Finally\, the cluster and individual estimations combined with information acquisition data show that the majority of seemingly fictitious plays coincide with the dominance of a belief-based updating pattern defined by information acquisition measures. Tracking subjects' information acquisition can be a complementary tool to study learning.

SUMMARY:Monday workshop: James Lake (SMU)
LOCATION:Menzies 269
DESCRIPTION:Title: Dynamic endogenous formation of trade agreements: flexibility versus coordination\n \nAbstract: Unlike the previous literature\, this paper endogenizes the choice between any type of trade agreement -- Customs Union (CU)\, Free Trade Agreement (FTA) or Most Favored Nation (MFN) agreement-- and shows how the presence of Preferential Trade Agreements (i.e. CU or FTA) affects the possibility of global free trade. The dynamic nature of the model captures an important tradeoff between the equilibrium type of Preferential Trade Agreement (PTA): while CU members coordinate tariffs imposed on nonmembers\, individual FTA members have the flexibility to form future PTAs with nonmembers. CUs can emerge in equilibrium because of this coordination benefit. However\, in such cases\, CUs may not lead to free trade implying that PTAs can prevent global free trade since global free trade is only attained when PTAs are banned. Nevertheless\, FTAs play an important role in limiting the destructive role of PTAs since a path of FTAs leading to global free trade can emerge in equilibrium because of the FTA flexibility benefit. Moreover\, surprisingly\, FTA free riding incentives strengthen the extent that FTAs limit the destructive role of PTAs.\n

DESCRIPTION:Title:An experimental study of bribery in the context of a public goods game with a single punisher\n\nWhen:March 15\, 12:15-1:30 pm\nWhere:Menzies\, E269\nAbstract\nBackground & Goal: Corruption is a widespread welfare reducing phenomenon. It can negatively affect the behavior of people in institutional roles\, thus threatening the institutional functioning and the achievement of its goals (e.g.\, some public good). The aim of the present study was to explore analogous causal mechanisms in an experimental situation. For this\, we evaluated bribery in the context of group cooperation and norm enforcement in an experimental game. \nMethods: We had groups formed by three contributors and a punisher playing a 10-round game (partner design) which comprised three stages per round: a contribution stage\, a transfer (bribery) stage\, and a punishment stage. In the contribution stage\, points put in the group account were multiplied by 1.3 and distributed back among the four members independently of their contribution. In the transfer stage\, participants (incl. the punisher) could transfer points to any of the other group members without any change in efficiency. Considering that the punisher had the highest endowment\, we considered transfers to the punisher as bribes. Last\, in the punishment stage\, the punisher could deduct points from any of the three contributors (the cost/deduction ratio was 1/5). However\, a participant could be deducted only as much points as the amount she did not contribute to the group account on that round (i.e.\, participants that made a full contribution could not be punished\, thus making the norm of cooperation stronger). We contrasted behavior in the treatment described above (the main treatment) against a control treatment which differed in two features: 1) participants were informed about the sum of the transfers received\, but not about the exact amount sent by each of her partners\, unlike the main treatment\; and 2) information about transfers received was given after the punishment stage in each round (as opposed to before\, as done in the main treatment).\nResults: Results in the main treatment showed that when participants contributed less to the group account\, they transferred more to the punisher. Moreover\, lower contributors in the main treatment suffered less punishment when they bribed than when they did not. In fact\, transfers to the punisher were higher and deductions were lower in the main treatment than in the control treatment. Despite treatment differences in deductions\, average contributions to the group account did not differ between treatments. Indeed\, the fact that transfers to the punisher resulted in lower levels of deductions in the main treatment without affecting contributions led to the paradoxical finding that profits were higher in the main treatment than in the control treatment. Therefore\, in our experimental protocol\, bribery led to higher efficiency. This could be partly explained by a higher use of the transfer mechanism to reward contributors in the main treatment relative to the control treatment.\nDiscussion: The possibility of a dyadic transfer from a lower contributor to the punisher led to the development of reciprocal exchanges which ended in lower enforcement of the cooperation norm\, as expected by how bribery is presumed to work. These exchanges between contributors and the punisher\, however\, did not cause cooperation to sink\, in contrast to what we predicted. Apparently\, the same mechanism that can be used for “wrong” (bribery) can also be used for “right” (reward high contributors). We discuss some potential explanations of why rewards were higher in the main treatment relative to the control treatment.

SUMMARY:Luc Borrowman (confirmation seminar) What impact do housing costs make on low income earners?
LOCATION:Menzies 269
DESCRIPTION:What impact do housing costs make on low income earners?\n\nThe purpose of this project is to examine existing measures of housing affordability\, and to modify them for actively portraying the socio-economic situation of low-income earners.  The two measures dealt with are ratio and residual ones. The ratio one is based on the calculation of the percentage of income spent on housing costs. The residual one is the income level after housing costs compared to budget standards. These budget standards are based on the estimated culturally acceptable needs of household in lower income brackets.   The suggested measures are used for two empirical approaches: (1) comparing the financial position with an estimate of a poverty line indicator that has been derived\, from the conventional one\, to cater for housing affordability analysis\; and (2) using the residual method and applying it to an ordered probit model to specify the variables that increase the likelihood of a household been in a particular residual income bracket.

SUMMARY:Joe Vecci (confirmation seminar) Status and Leadership in a public good experiment.
LOCATION:Menzies 269
DESCRIPTION:Status and Leadership in a public good experiment.\n\nAbstract: Leaders play an important role in society\, they not only\nfacilitate cooperation but they are also role models that are followed\nby their peers. This paper will investigate the role of status and its\neffect on leaders in a public good laboratory experiment.\nSpecifically\, I\nwill examine if participants follow leaders because of what they do or\nwho they are.  Status will be induced in two ways:  1) by providing\nparticipants with a quiz\, where the higher scoring participants are\nlabelled high status\; 2) by using the father’s occupation as a measure\nof\nstatus\, where participants whose fathers have a more skilled job\,\naccording to the Australian Socioeconomic Index are labelled high\nstatus. Leaders lead using an information communication method called\n‘cheap talk’ which provides a greater reward to those who act as\nleaders. This paper will give us a better understanding of the\nperceived trustworthiness and leadership ability of elites. With this\ninformation we will be in a better position to understand how status\naffects the allocation of resources among individuals and communities.

DESCRIPTION:FDI and Export Diversification. \n\nTitle: FDI and Export Diversification\n\nAbstract\nCasual inspection of available evidence suggests that the magnitude of FDI is correlated\nwith the extent of export diversification. Yet little is known about the nature of this\nlink. To fill this gap in the literature\, we propose an inframarginal 2*2*2 Heckscher-\nOhlin model of trade that allows capital mobility and technological differences across\ncountries. The model shows that as trade costs decline the capital scarce country imports\ncapital (inward FDI) and exports a greater variety of goods. We also provide\nempirical evidence with IV regressions using highly disaggregated US imports data (at\n10-digit level). Overall\, the results confirm the export diversifying effect of FDI. But\nfurther tests show that FDI acts as export diversifier in developing countries only\, while\nadvanced countries seem to reduce the variety of exports due to multinationals.

SUMMARY:Monday Workshop: Noel Gaston (Productivity Commission) International Migration and OECD Welfare States
LOCATION:E269 Menzies
DESCRIPTION:Title: International Migration and OECD Welfare States\n\nAbstract: Immigration is a controversial topic in Australia and most other OECD countries. Given the potential impact on native welfare\, such as effects on relative wages and unemployment\, there has been political mobilisation on the immigration question. The presence of a redistributive welfare state in all major immigrant host countries creates yet another margin on which immigration affects native welfare. In recent research my co-authors and I have examined whether a large intake of immigrants leads to a reduction in welfare state effort. It is often argued that steady increases in immigration lead to public pressure for stricter immigration controls or for less generous publicly funded social expenditures. In terms of immigrants with similar employability and claims on the public purse to natives\, it is hypothesised that the impact on welfare spending is neutral. These ideas are tested using data for migration to developed countries.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:Lutfunnahar Begum (Monash University\nTitle:Identifying Gender Bias in Parental ‘Attitude’: An Experimental Approach\n\nWhen:May 3\, 12:15-1:30 pm\nWhere:Menzies\, E269\nAbstract:This paper attempts to identify parental attitude towards different gender children\, using an experimental approach. This study differs from the existing literature on gender bias in its focus on parental ‘attitude’ towards different-gender children rather than looking at the ultimate parental decision of resource allocation among children. The experiment was conducted in a number of villages of Khulna district in Bangladesh\, with randomly selected households\, who have at least two school aged (6-18 years) children of different gender. The parents of the households were given an endowment to benefit an anonymous girl and an anonymous boy. The households were randomly assigned to one of the four mutually exclusive groups\, corresponding to different experiment conditions\, viz.\, private\, individual  decisions without allocation restrictions\; private\, individual decisions with allocation restrictions\; joint decisions without allocation restrictions\; and\, joint decisions with allocation restrictions. The results suggest that there is no systematic cultural bias in parental attitudes towards the gender of a child. I do not find any significant difference in the attitudes of fathers and mothers\; neither have I found any significant differences in individual versus joint decisions. The results suggest that subjects revealed their true preferences under the experimental set-up. My main results are robust in alternative treatment conditions and alternative specifications.

SUMMARY:Jackie So (pre-submission seminar) Event subscription and non-cooperative network formation
LOCATION:Menzies E269
DESCRIPTION:Event subscription and non-cooperative network formation\n \nAbstract: We study a non-cooperative network formation model with two primitives -- a set of agents and a set of events -- which is motivated by the observation that connections between agents are often determined by their individual decisions regarding which events to join. An event is conceived as any entity around which joint activities can be organized and agents decide which subset of events to subscribe to. We first study a benchmark model with homogeneous agents\, identical subscription costs\, and no decay in benefits from indirect connections. The unique non-empty efficient architecture can be sustained as the strict Nash equilibrium despite the fact that agents do not take into account the externalities arising from their individual decisions. This lack of tension between efficiency and stability continues to hold even when benefits from indirect connections are subject to decay. In order to contrast our results from the existing literature and clarify the reasons behind these differences\, we analyze an insider-outsider model involving multiple groups of agents where each group has its own low cost internal event which serves as a high cost external event for every other group.

Markets populated by human traders are known to be capable of converging to rational expectations equilibria. This paper reports comparable market outcomes when human traders are replaced by boundedly-rational algorithmic agents who use a simple means-end heuristic. These algorithmic agents lack the capability to optimize\; yet outcomes of markets populated by them converge near the equilibrium derived from optimization assumptions. These findings point to market structure (rather than cognition or optimization) being an important determinant of efficient aggregate level outcomes.\n \nhttp://www.econ.yale.edu/seminars/microt/mt12/sunder-13-05-07.pdf

SUMMARY:Monday Workshop: Kompal Sinha (Monash EBS) Estimating Purchasing Power Parities from Household Expenditure Data Using Complete Demand Systems with Application to Living Standards Comparison: India and Vietnam
LOCATION:Menzies 269
DESCRIPTION:Title: Estimating Purchasing Power Parities from Household Expenditure Data Using Complete Demand Systems with Application to Living Standards Comparison: India and Vietnam\n\nAuthors: Amita Majumder\, Ranjan Ray and Kompal Sinha\n\nPresenter: Kompal Sinha\n\nAbstract:\nThis study departs from the previous literature on purchasing power parity (PPP) by proposing a demand system based methodology for calculating the PPP that takes account of consumer preferences and allows for the substitution effect of price changes. The methodology is used to calculate the PPP between the Indian Rupee and the Vietnamese Dong. The study allows for regional variation in preferences and price changes both inside the country and between countries. It proposes and applies a methodology for constructing prices from unit values after adjusting them for quality and demographic effects. The adjusted unit values are used as prices in the demand estimations\, and the demand parameter estimates are used to calculate both spatial prices within each country and the PPP between the two countries within a consistent framework. The study illustrates the usefulness of preference consistent methods to calculate the PPP by applying the PPPs to compare living standards between India and Vietnam. The significance of the results follows from the fact that the levels of living comparisons are quite sensitive to the PPP used in converting the Rupee expenditures into Vietnamese Dong. The present results on food PPPs question the relevance of the PPPs from the ICP project in cross-country welfare comparisons especially in a period of high food inflation.

SUMMARY:Seminar: Valerie Smeets (Aarhus University)
LOCATION:Caulfield Campus\, H4.87
DESCRIPTION:Title: Rethinking Deindustrialization (joint with Andrew Bernard and Frederic Warzynski. Please see attached paper)\nAbstract\n\nThis paper examines the decline in manufacturing in Denmark from 1994 to 2007. As in almost every other high-income country\, manufacturing employment and the number of manufacturing firms in Denmark have been shrinking as a share of the total and in absolute levels. Most of the decline of manufacturing is due to firm exit and reduced employment at surviving manufacturers. However\, a portion of the recorded decline is due to firms switching industries\, from manufacturing to service sectors. We focus on this last group of firms\, asking what they looked like before switched and how they fared after the switch. Overall this is a group of small high productivity firms that grow more rapidly after they switch. By 2007\, employment at these former manufacturers equals 10 percent of manufacturing employment\, reducing the apparent decline in manufacturing employment by about one half.

Please see attached paper)\nAbstract\n\nUsing detailed firm-product level quarterly data\, we develop an estimation framework of a Multi-Product Production Function (MPPF) and look at the relationship between firm-product level productivity and import competition. We find that productivity at the firm level tends to react positively to increased import competition. However\, multi-product firms respond differently to import competition depending on the relative importance of the product: when import competition associated to the main product of a firm increases\, the firm tend to increase its efficiency in producing that core product\; but increased foreign competition has the opposite effect for non core products of a firm. Consequently\, firms tend to be more likely to drop products that are not core\, for which they have lower productivity\, and where import competition increased. Our results are in line with recent models of multi-product firms.

SUMMARY:[Wed-Deptt Seminar]: Tim Cason (Distinguished visitor)
LOCATION:Bldg 11\, Rm N9.02 (9th floor)\, Clayton
DESCRIPTION:Enhancing Fundraising with Refund Bonuses \nAbstract: The provision point mechanism as a method of funding threshold public goods is ex- tended with refund bonuses. Each contributor not only has his contribution refunded in the case of insufficient contributions but also receives a refund bonus proportional to his proposed contribution. As long as the refund bonus pool does not exceed the net value of the public good\, in equilibrium the public good is always provided and refund bonuses are never distributed. In this paper\, we empirically investigate this extension of the provision point mechanism in a laboratory experiment by testing its properties on allocative and distributive efficiency\, equilibrium coordination\, and invariance to in- formation distribution. Individuals respond to the incentives induced by refund bonuses as predicted\, but systematic deviations exist that are consistent with quantal response equilibrium. Since this simple mechanism has considerable practical potential especially in crowdfunding\, these promising initial results call for further experimental work.

SUMMARY:[BET Seminar] The Justice of Unfair Income Inequality: A General Theory of Class
LOCATION:Menzies\, E269
DESCRIPTION:Why would people find\, even ex ante\, unfair income inequality to be justifiable?  People find unfairness to be a justifiable when production involves fixed costs.  Behind the veil of ignorance\, one joins society X because of the hope that X might invent a desired club good—a 100% fixed-cost good.  The club good amounts to capital tools.  To employ them\, the social contract must invent trust.  If the club good is feasible\, the social contract awards the inventors almost all the surplus (rent)\, which engenders upper and lower classes.  People find the class system\, although unfair\, to be just\, as long as both classes abide by the social contract.  The club good is the first pillar of the solution.  But given that the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium is for each party to violate the contract and steal what the other class already possesses\, the social contract must invent minimal trust.  Minimal trust is thin—only needed to prevent people from such stealing.  Thin-trust is sufficient to guarantee cooperation in one-shot game because it functions as a multi-sided-precommitment that transforms a social dilemma into a game of chicken with credible threats.  The precommitment is the non-strategic retaliation once one is betrayed—similar to the “mutually assured destruction” (MAD) doctrine underlying nuclear deterrence.  Everyone is biologically engineered to retaliate.  The retaliation has\, unlike Kreps et al. [1982]\, a reason: each member wants to “express” oneself to satisfy self-integrity.  If the thin-trust were not betrayed\, there would be no raison d'être to retaliate.  Thin-trust is the second pillar of the solution to the puzzle.  The proposed two-pillar hypothesis\, club-good-and-trust\, has many implications.  It allows us to identify the criterion upon which people judge whether their unfair class system is just—viz.\, whether the classes abide by the thin-trust embodied in the social contract.

SUMMARY:PhD seminar series - Anwesha Bandyopadhyay
LOCATION:BusEco-Meeting room CL_20Chn_RmN902
DESCRIPTION:TITLE: “Women and Entrepreneurship: Experimental evidence from India”\n\nABSTRACT: MFIs are popular source of providing microcredit to women from lower income families to help them become entrepreneurs. Using MFI (in India) as the set-up\, we plan to observe if female members of MFI are better bargainers than non-members\, both male and female. We plan to use a simple Ultimatum Game to study bargaining behaviour. However\, we also plan to observe other aspects of behavioural difference between men and women in general like competitiveness (competition game – real effort task)\, risk preference (a simple gamble with no loss condition) and time preference (a simple time preference game). These traits are crucial components of bargaining and entrepreneurship. This will also provide clues as to whether female members of MFI have greater chance of being successful entrepreneurs.\n\nLight lunch is provided thanks to generous support from the department\, through Michael Ward.\n\nIf you are interested in presenting in the series or want more information\, please email  zachary.dorner@monash.edu.\n\nThe seminar series is a chance for PhD students to practise and improve presentation skills. At the same time it's an opportunity for PhD students to develop their ability to be a discussant by broadening their knowledge and asking their fellow students questions in an informal relaxed environment.\n\nThe seminar is usually held every 2 weeks during semesters 1 and 2\, Tuesdays 12-1pm. Campus location will vary according to speaker’s preference. \n\nTypes of presentations topics include:\n-          Proposals or initial results from PhD research\n\n-          Formal presentations in preparation for an upcoming conference or milestone seminar\n\n-          Discussion of a recent or important paper in the literature\n\n-          A skills session by a member of academic staff or visitor

SUMMARY:Economics PhD seminar series - Frank Liu (Econometrics Department)
LOCATION:BusEco-Meeting Room CL_20Chn_RmN1102
DESCRIPTION:Title: A Bayesian Restricted Likelihood Method for Instrumental Variable Regression\n\nAbstract:\nA new Bayesian restricted likelihood (BRL) method is discussed\, which intends to provide robust inference when the underlying model suffers from some level of misspecification. We extend the BRL technique to an instrumental variable (IV) regression setting. We explore a new class of robust IV estimator in order to construct the summary statistics for BRL inference\, and develop a computation strategy to conduct robust Bayesian inference. We show the performance of the new BRL method in a simulation experiment. Finally we use the BRL method to examine the relationship between inflation and openness and compare the inference with traditional non-robust method.\n\nHeld at Clayton\, room N1102.\n\nTuesday 19 April\, 12pm to 1pm.\n\nLight lunch is provided thanks to generous support from the Economics Department.\n\nIf you are interested in presenting in the series or want more information\, please email  zachary.dorner@monash.edu.\n\nThe seminar series is a chance for PhD students to practise and improve presentation skills. At the same time it's an opportunity for PhD students to develop their ability to be a discussant by broadening their knowledge and asking their fellow students questions in an informal relaxed environment.\n\nThe seminar is usually held every 2 weeks during semesters 1 and 2\, Tuesdays 12-1pm.

SUMMARY:PhD seminar - Alexis Tan
LOCATION:BusEco-Meeting room CL_20Chn_Rm9.01\, BusEco-Meeting room CL_20Chn_RmN902
DESCRIPTION:This is Alex's mid-candidature seminar.\n\nTitle: Risk Attitudes and Risky Behaviour of Brothel Sex Workers in Bangladesh\n\nAbstract: Previous studies claim that risk attitudes are domain-specific. Some argue that risk attitudes derived from financial games are unable to predict health outcomes\, while some studies find otherwise. In my paper\, I test the domain-specificity of risk attitudes by examining whether risk attitudes derived from a lottery choice game or risk attitudes measured using six risky health behaviours (smoking\, consumption of alcohol\, cannabis\, heroin\, yaba/madness drug\, and addiction to phensidyl/cough syrup) can predict the commercial safe sex behaviour of brothel sex workers in Bangladesh. I find that risk attitudes derived from the lottery game do not have a significant relationship with the probability of sex workers engaging in safe sex transactions with their clients. It also does not have a significant relationship with the probability of sex workers initiating condom use in safe sex transactions. These results show that risk attitudes are domain specific\, that is\, financial risk attitudes are unable to predict non-financial outcomes. On the other hand\, I find that a sex worker who either drinks or consumes stimulant drugs (yaba/madness drug) is less likely to engage in safe sex transactions by approximately 7 per cent\, and 5 per cent respectively. In addition\, a sex worker who drinks is 9 per cent less likely to be the one initiating condom use in safe sex transactions. In both instances\, there is an insignificant relationship between the smoking statuses of sex workers and their commercial safe sex behaviour. This insignificant relationship is in contrast to studies that find that smokers are more likely to engage in hazardous behaviours.\n\nIt will be held on 24 May\, 12pm to 1:15pm in N902 on Clayton.

SUMMARY:Pre-submission seminar - Vilas Gobin
LOCATION:BusEco-Meeting Room CL_20Chn_RmN1101\, BusEco-Meeting Room CL_20Chn_RmN1102
DESCRIPTION:In this paper\, the impact of a poverty graduation program on female empowerment\nis estimated. Women who participated in this program and their spouses\nwere invited to take part in an incentivised decision-making task designed to\nderive an objective indicator of empowerment. This measure is compared with\ntraditional survey measures of empowerment. A positive impact of participation\nin the program on empowerment is found when it is measured using an\nexperimental indicator\, but no significant effect is found when using traditional\nsurvey measures. The experimental indicator is also found to better correlate\nwith indicators of well-being that are associated with more empowered women.

It is a research intensive workshop\, featuring in depth presentations and discussions amongst a small group of Australia’s leading early and mid-career environmental economists. Methodologies covered include theoretical\, experimental and econometric approaches. A major focus of the workshop is to strengthen research linkages among participants and we hope to attract again excellent presenters from around Australia and Monash University. The workshop is jointly sponsored by the Centre for Development Economics and Sustainability and the Department of Economics. For more information please contact Zack Dorner or Anke Leroux.\n

SUMMARY:Wednesday seminar (Professor Kaushik Basu\, Cornell)
LOCATION:BusEco-Meeting room CL_20Chn_Rm9.01\, BusEco-Meeting room CL_20Chn_RmN902
DESCRIPTION:The discipline of law and economics deals with wide-ranging topics\, from competition and environmental policy to crime control\, and has been instrumental in determining how an economy performs. Yet its success has fallen short of its potential. The discipline’s shortcomings are nowhere as visible as in developing economies\, where a common refrain is how the law looks good on paper but does not get implemented. This paper articulates a methodological flaw that underlies much of contemporary law and economics\, and argues that there is an intimate connection between human beliefs and expectations\, on the one hand\, and the effectiveness of the law\, on the other. I propose a new approach to law and economics that is rooted in game theory and rectifies the flaw. It is argued that this approach can open up new areas of research and be marshalled to address some of the more pressing policy challenges of our time.

DESCRIPTION:Blessing or Curse? International Portfolio Diversification Possibilities in BRICSs' Emerging Stock Markets under External Shocks\n\nAbstract: In this paper\, we argue that compared with other emerging markets\, BRICSs' stock markets are more likely to be the first choice for both developed and developing country investors to diversify their portfolio risks given their dominant role in the global economy. We incorporate multiple structural breaks in our empirical analysis that previous studies have been neglected to investigate diversification opportunities among BRICSs' stock markets in the periods of large shocks. Cointegration results suggest that BRICSs' stock markets are desired places for long-term investors to reduce risks in the recession times. Results for full sample bootstrap Granger non-causality analysis prove that short-term investors cannot diversify risks among BRICS association. Moreover\, a fixed size rolling-window subsample Granger non-causality test is applied to further investigate the diversification possibilities among BRICSs' stock markets in the periods of shocks\, and our findings indicate that the opportunities are extremely limited.

DESCRIPTION:Parental Time Investment in Children: Evidence from Australia\n\nAbstract: Using unique data on time use from the Longitudinal Survey of Australian Children\, the paper explores patterns of time investment of parents in children from the first year of life until adolescence\, and how such investment affects childrens’ cognitive development. The analysis shows the existence of a positive gradient by education in time spent doing interactive and educational activities with children at the expense of only a passive presence of parents. Moreover the time parents spend in educational activities has a positive effect on the child’s academic achievement\, further reinforcing advantage of children from families with higher human capital.

SUMMARY:Macro/Trade Seminar (Paul Lau\, U of Hong Kong)
LOCATION:H4.34 (Caulfield)
DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Professor Paul Lau (University of Hong Kong)\nTitle: Mortality decline\, productivity increase\, and positive feedback between schooling and retirement choices\nAbstract: \nThe twentieth century has seen a phenomenal decline in mortality and increase in productivity level. We study the effects of these two important events on optimal schooling years and retirement age. It is shown that positive feedback between these two endogenous variables exists. Because of the positive feedback\, either a mortality or productivity shock leads to interesting results regarding the sign and magnitude of the effects on the schooling years and retirement age\, under some conditions. Economic intuitions of the results are developed in a model emphasizing the sole importance of the Ben-Porath mechanism and another model including the direct utility benefit of schooling.\n\nEmail:laushp@hku.hk\nWebsite:http://www.sef.hku.hk/~pshlau

SUMMARY:Macro/Trade Seminar (Akihiko Kaneko\, Waseda)
LOCATION:H4.34 (Caulfield)
DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Professor Akihiko Kaneko (Waseda University) \n\nTitle: Oligopolistic competition in the banking market and economic growth (w. Kojun Hamada - Niigata University & Mitsuyoshi Yanagihara - Nagoya University)\n\nAbstract: \nWe investigate how banks' degree of imperfect competition affects economic growth. This study explores an imperfect competition model in banking in an overlapping generations model with endogenous growth. We demonstrate the following results. First\, an increase in the deposit interest rate increases the steady growth rate of the economy. Second\, as competition among banks intensifies\, the economic growth rate increases. Third\, it is ambiguous as to whether a higher lending interest rate caused by an increase in productivity results in a higher economic growth rate. In our numerical exercises\, we exemplify the possibility that an increase in the lending interest rate increases the growth rate.\n\nEmail: akaneko@waseda.jp\nWebsite: http://researchers.waseda.jp/profile/en.74ce05ed9228c54d13090912eeddb85f.html

SUMMARY:Wed Seminar -- jointly with BET
LOCATION:N901 -- Wed Seminar
DESCRIPTION:LU Dong--University of Nottingham\n\nTitle: Favoritism\, monitoring and equity in team production\nAbstract: Costless peer evaluation can obtain equitable profit sharing and promote efficiency in team production. A challenge\, however\, occurs when team members are from different social groups and peer evaluations require a small monitoring cost. Here\, we present experimental evidence showing that team members from the same social group sometimes ignore or even avoid knowing each other’s unworthy behavior\, and they distribute unjustly to each other’s advantage. This blind favoritism creates strong disincentives for a third person who is from a different social group to produce and to properly evaluate other members’ relative efforts. We discuss the implications of our findings for work ethics and team organization.\n\nWebpage: www.ludong.weebly.com \n

SUMMARY:PhD confirmation seminar: Md. Main Uddin
LOCATION:BusEco-Meeting room CL_20Chn_Rm9.01
DESCRIPTION:Remittances and Well-being\n\nInward remittances make one of the most palpable contributions to the economies of Low Income (LICs) and Lower Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). We examine the impact of inward remittances on wellbeing for 74 LICs and LMICs. To measure wellbeing\, we use the inequality adjusted human development index (IHDI) and happiness indices. We give specific attention to addressing endogeneity and time invariant cross country heterogeneity. This study makes an important contribution to the existing literature through being the first to examine the effect of remittances on wellbeing in developing economies.\n

DESCRIPTION:Dr. Mohammad Davoodalhosseini\, Bank of Canada\n\nTitle: Central Bank Digital Currency and Monetary Policy\n\nAbstract: \nMany central banks\, including the Bank of Canada\, are contemplating whether to issue central bank digital currency (CDBC) or not. If they do\, CBDC will coexist with other means of payments including cash. CDBC has certain possible advantages including the possibility that it can bear interest rate. On the other hand\, cash may be preferred by agents over CBDC\, perhaps because agents can remain anonymous by using cash. Interactions between cash and CBDC have not been understood well in the literature. I put together a model in which cash and CBDC co-exist and agents with heterogeneous transaction needs can choose their portfolios with varying mixtures. Using this model\, I investigate how monetary policy is affected by the introduction of CBDC\, and study the circumstances under which such introduction is desirable. I show that CBDC provides more flexibility for the central bank to conduct monetary policy. In an empirical exercise\, the welfare gains of introducing CBDC are estimated to be up to 0.7% for Canada.\n\n\nEmail: davo@bankofcanada.ca\nWeb: http://www.bankofcanada.ca/profile/mohammad-davoodalhosseini/\nWeb: https://sites.google.com/site/davoodalhosseini/\n

LOCATION:H4.87 (Caulfield)
DESCRIPTION:Speaker:Dr. Christian Gillitzer (U of Sydney)\n\nTitle: Do Political Attitudes Affect Consumers’ Inflation Expectations? \nAbstract:\nWhat sources of information do consumers use in forming their inflation expectations? We show for the United States and Australia that consumers report significantly lower inflation expectations when the political party they support holds executive office. This is surprising because both the United States Federal Reserve and the Reserve Bank of Australia set monetary policy to achieve price stability free from political control. Our findings cannot be explained by previously documented sources of heterogeneity in consumer inflation expectations nor models of imperfect information and rational inattention. We argue that our findings are most consistent with Gennaioli and Shleifer's (2010) model of local thinking. We discuss implications for central bank communication.\n\nEmail: christian.gillitzer@sydney.edu.au\nWeb: http://sydney.edu.au/arts/economics/staff/profiles/christian.gillitzer.php

In contrast to the findings of Antras and Caballero (2009\, Journal of Political Economy)\, free trade may amplify the global imbalances (a phenomenon of large financial flows from developing to developed countries observed in the recent decades)\, if trade-driven sectoral shifts allow the more financially developed country (North) to fully abandon low-return production activities and upgrade to high-return activities along the value chains. This way\, I complement the findings of Antras and Caballero (2009) and discover a novel mechanism through which the substantial fall in trade costs and the boom in supply-chain trade may contribute to the recent global imbalances. \n

Andres\, J. E. Bosca and J. Ferri)\n\nAbstract: \nUsing PSID data from 1999 to 2013\, we identify six household categories as a function of the household balance-sheet composition. We document a decline in the share of patient households and an increase in the share of households with negative wealth. We explore the role of the observed changes in the distribution of households in the transmission of government spending shocks using a DSGE model with search and matching and six types of households. We show that (i) the response of individual consumption is negatively correlated with household's net wealth and positively correlated with indebtedness\; (ii) aggregate output and consumption multipliers are positively correlated with the share of households with negative wealth and with overall wealth inequality\; (iii) the employment multiplier is negatively correlated with the share of households with negative wealth\; and (iv) an expansionary government spending shock translates into a welfare cost for wealthy households and a welfare gain for financially constrained households. Therefore\, the size of the share of households in the left tail of the wealth distribution plays a key role in the aggregate marginal propensity to consume\, the value of the fiscal multiplier\, and the distributional consequences of fiscal shocks.

We develop and analyze the dynamics and determinacy properties of a sticky-price model with trend inflation\, real wage rigidity and cost-push shocks. We estimate this model using a Sequential Monte Carlo algorithm while allowing for indeterminacy. To identify cost-push shocks\, our estimation utilizes data on both core and headline inflation. Unlike the literature’s preponderant conception\, our analysis does not find empirical support for the view that monetary policy provoked equilibrium indeterminacy during the 1970’s.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Nikhil Damodaran\, Louisiana State University\n\nDate: 16 October 2017\nTime: 3:00pm - 4:15pm\nVenue: Room H 4.87 (Caulfield)\n\nTitle: Fiscal Transmission in Currency Unions\n\nAbstract: \nThis paper analyzes the international transmission of sales tax and government spending to compare their effectiveness in stimulating recovery for a currency union member. A tax reduction which mimics devaluation for a currency union member generates a larger output expansion for the home country as compared to a direct demand intervention which takes the form of an increase in government spending. However\, such a devaluation occurs at the expense of its trading partner's output unlike a government spending increase. This decline outweighs the gain in output for the home country causing a fall in aggregate currency union output. The presence of a zero bound on nominal policy rates does not change the relative gains of relying on external demand for home country with comparable transmission effects.

Cho & L. Uren)\n\nAbstract: \nThis paper explores the implications of negative gearing tax associated with housing investment by conducting a quantitative study of the Australian housing market. We build a general equilibrium overlapping generations model with incomplete markets and heterogeneous agents which features income taxes and negative gearing tax that are consistent with the Australian practice. Comparing across the stationary equilibria with and without negative gearing tax\, we find that removing negative gearing would result in lower house prices\, higher rents and homeownership rate. Improvements in homeownership rate are observed predominantly among young and middle-aged households who are relatively poor. The welfare analysis suggests that eliminating negative gearing would lead to an overall welfare gain of 1.5 percent for the Australian economy in which 76 percent of households become better off. However\, the welfare effects are heterogeneous across different households. Renters and owner-occupiers are winners\, but landlords\, especially young with high earnings\, lose.

Hansen and M. Hsu)\n\nAbstract: \nWe build a life-cycle model of household consumption and saving decisions\, where long term care (LTC) expenditures are endogenous. We use an LTC-state dependent utility function where regular consumption and LTC are valued differently. The model includes both married and single households\, thus capturing important family dynamics that are important for precautionary savings and LTC decisions. Married individuals face the risk of a spouse needing LTC and quickly depleting joint assets. However\, those needing LTC can benefit from the presence of a healthy spouse who provides informal care\, lowering the costs of LTC given a fixed quality of care. We use the calibrated model to estimate the importance of family dynamics for savings and consumption decisions\, and also to quantify the impacts of LTC policy reforms such as the provision of a universal public system that pays for a minimum level of LTC costs.

Using the firm level data in China during 2000 and 2007\, we study how the sectoral effective tax rate and macro effective tax rate vary with the value-added share of the mining sectors in the whole manufacturing sectors. We use an instrument variable to deal with the endogeneity problem of the share of mining sectors. The results show that the effective VAT rate of the non-mining sectors rises as the value-added share of the mining sectors falls\, and vice versa. However\, both the macro effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate remain constant. This finding is robust to two alternative measurements of tax enforcement - the total effective tax rate and the profit gap rate. The findings suggest cyclical tax enforcement can be conducted at the sectoral level as a response to the compositional change in tax base\, while the tax smoothing can still be achieved at the macro level. In the end\, by comparing across counties and industries\, we show that the volatile effective tax rates consequently reduce number of firms and only big rmfi survive. The results reveal that the volative tax enforcement can be a mechanism underlying the resource curse.\n

DESCRIPTION:Title: \nSpatial Variation in Higher Education Financing and the Supply of College Graduates\nAbstract:\nIn the U.S. there are large differences across States in the extent to which college education is subsidized\, and there are also large differences across States in the proportion of college graduates in the labor force. State subsidies are apparently motivated in part by the perceived benefits of having a more educated workforce. The paper extends the migration model of Kennan and Walker (2011) to analyze how geographical variation in college education subsidies affects the migration decisions of college graduates. The model is estimated using NLSY data\, and used to quantify the sensitivity of migration and college enrollment decisions to differences in expected net lifetime income\, focusing on how cross-State differences in public college financing affect the educational composition of the labor force. The main finding is that these differences have substantial effects on college enrollment\, and that these effects are not dissipated through migration.\nThe paper is available on: \nwww.ssc.wisc.edu/~jkennan/research/HumanCapitalMobility.pdf

SUMMARY:Mid-candidature Seminar: Miethy Zaman
DESCRIPTION:\nVenue: H4.87\n\n\nTitle: How Does Institutions Transmit to Economic Growth in Latin America: 1801-2015\n\nAbstract: \nLatin American economic growth has been under considerable debate. The importance of history and colonial backgrounds for institutional development is extensively discussed in the literature. Using a new settler weighted time-varying instrument for institutions\, we revisit these issues by examining the three transmission channels through which institutions transmits to growth: investment\, education\, and knowledge production. We constructed a unique panel data for seven Latin American countries spanning over 200 years to test our hypothesis. The empirical results show that institutions influences growth through all the three channels and the settlers’ stock is important for institutional development.

DESCRIPTION:Title:&nbsp\;Spillover Effects in Technology Adoption<br>Abstract:&nbsp\;<br>Spillover effects on technology adoption are of interests in economists. We present in this paper the evidence and mechanism about spillover effects in technology adoption on farmers in rural Bangladesh. We rely on idiosyncratic variations in share of treated farmers across villages based on successful randomization. It is found that spillover effects of providing training had significant positive effects on improving technology adoption. An increase in the proportion of treated farmers lead to a significant improvement on untreated farmer’s adoption decision.

SUMMARY:Applied/CDES Seminar: Paola Giuliano (UCLA Anderson School of Management)
DESCRIPTION:<p><b>Date</b>: Thursday&nbsp\;29<sup>th</sup>&nbsp\;October&nbsp\;&nbsp\;</p><p><b>Time</b>:&nbsp\;11AM-12:15PM</p><p><b>Title:</b>&nbsp\;The Seeds of Ideology: Historical Immigration and Political Preferences in the United States</p><p><b>Abstract:&nbsp\;</b>We test the relationship between historical immigration to the United States and political ideology today. We hypothesize that European immigrants brought with them their preferences for the welfare state\, and that this had a long-lasting effect on the political ideology of US born individuals. Our analysis proceeds in three steps. First\, we document that the historical presence of European immigrants is associated with a more liberal political ideology and with stronger preferences for redistribution among US born individuals today. Next\, we show that this correlation is not driven by the characteristics of the counties where immigrants settled or other specific\, socioeconomic immigrants’ traits. Finally\, we provide evidence that immigrants brought with them their preferences for the welfare state from their countries of origin. Consistent with the hypothesis that immigration left its footprint on American ideology via cultural transmission from immigrants to natives\, we show that our results are stronger when inter-group contact between natives and immigrants\, measured with either intermarriage or residential integration\, was higher. Our findings also indicate that immigrants influenced American political ideology during one of the largest episodes of redistribution in US history — the New Deal – and that such effects persisted after the initial shock.</p><p><br></p>\n\nJoin Zoom Meeting\n[signup link removed] (ID: 97403783746\, password: 07456660)\n\nJoin by phone\n(US) +1 877-369-0926\n\nJoining instructions: https://www.google.com/url?q=https://applications.zoom.us/addon/invitation/detail?meetingUuid%3D2Lg8PGilT7aQSUVI1XCgjg%253D%253D%26signature%3Dced437ca127407340f99b318b3435dd4613f78c0dcb05df92f7f00a95a5dbb75&sa=D&source=calendar&usg=AOvVaw0HuT4FXbPT8HDjEsTCj5tx\n\nPasscode: 07456660

SUMMARY:Weijia Li Brown Bag Seminar

In each period\, each council member first decides whether to contest the kingship and thus start a civil conflict\, and then the resulting king can propose to persecute and expropriate some council members\, subject to the council’s approval by a given decision rule. We show that in this weakly institutionalized environment\, only unanimity rule can confer civil peace\, whereas any other decision rule leads to a perpetual Hobbesian war\, in which in each period every council member contests the kingship. After allowing the decision rule to be chosen at the end of each period\, we show that who – the king or the council – sets the constitutional agenda is critical to the dynamics of political regimes. In an extension of the model\, we further show that non-unanimity rule\, such as majoritarian rule\, can confer civil peace\, only if social cohesion among the elite is suﬀiciently high&nbsp\;<i>and</i>&nbsp\;if there is a suﬀiciently insulated judiciary to veto persecutions. We discuss the implications of our results on a wide range of political-economic issues with historical and contemporary examples.<br><br><u>Zoom link:&nbsp\;</u><br><br>Time: Dec 2\, 2021 02:00 PM Australia/Melbourne<br>Join from a PC\, Mac\, iPad\, iPhone or Android device:<br><br>&nbsp\;

Not only do the emissions of firms decrease as FOI laws become stronger\, the overall level of emissions in a state is negatively related to the total number of FOI requests received by the state’s environmental department or agency. Notably\, the negative association between the strength of FOI laws and pollution emissions is concentrated in states with lower pollution abatement costs\, more efficient governments\, more lenient environmental policies\, and higher preexisting levels of public corruption. These findings suggest that strengthening public access to information on governmental activities\, especially those related to the regulation and monitoring of industrial pollution\, mitigates polluting behavior. <u></u><br><u></u>

SUMMARY:Macro/Trade seminar  Nabeeh Zakariyya (ANU)
LOCATION:Caulfield H4.87
DESCRIPTION:Hi everyone\,<br><br>Our next macro/trade seminar on Monday 11 April 11am-12:15pm will be&nbsp\;held&nbsp\;on-campus (H4.87 Caulfield). Please see the details below\, we look forward to seeing&nbsp\;many of&nbsp\;you there.<br><br><br><br><b>Speaker</b>:&nbsp\;<a href="https://nabeehz.com/">Nabeeh Zakariyya</a>&nbsp\;(ANU)<br><br><b>Title</b>:&nbsp\;On the limits of fiscal financing in Australia (<a href="https://tinyurl.com/sh4uh5pe">link to paper</a>)<br><br><b>Abstract</b>:&nbsp\;The fiscal challenges owing to the pandemic\, natural disasters\, low population growth and an ageing population means that Australia faces decades of debt and deficit. Given this context\, we examine the extent to which the Australian government could finance its pension and other expenditures\, and its debt through changes to the tax system. Using a dynamic general equilibrium overlapping generations model with skill heterogeneity and uninsurable labour productivity risk\, we simulate various changes to the tax system to estimate Laffer curves of tax revenue against tax rates and other tax parameters. Our focus is on the peak of the Laffer curves beyond which further changes lead to declining revenues (fiscal limit)\; and the maximum potential revenue at the peak compared to the status quo (fiscal space). Specifically\, we analyse changes to the progressivity and scale of the income tax system\, consumption tax rates and company income tax rates. Of these taxes\, a flat income tax has the potential to raise the most revenue. Depending on the degree of openness of the economy\, the fiscal limit of Australia's income tax system is a flat tax rate between 50% under closed economy assumptions and 75% under perfect capital mobility. This represents a fiscal space between 81% - 121% of current tax revenue levels.<br><br><b>Venue:</b>&nbsp\;Caulfield H4.87<br><br>Please&nbsp\;<b>sign up for meetings\, lunch and dinner</b>&nbsp\;via google sheets (link&nbsp\;<a href="[signup link removed]">here</a>) by going to the relevant sheet.

SUMMARY:Brown Bag Seminar Stefanie Fischer
LOCATION:BusEco-Seminar room H_4.87 (25) Caulfield
DESCRIPTION:<html-blob>Hi Everyone<br><br>Stefanie Fischer is presenting our first brown bag of the year at Caulfield next Wednesday (note this is different from our standard Tuesday) 12-1 in room H4.87. See title and abstract below and the paper attached.<br><br>Title: Keep Me in\, Coach: Can Coaching Improve Marginal College Students' Outcomes?<br><br>This paper evaluates a light-touch group coaching program intended to enhance<br>college persistence of first-year students who are at risk of dropping out. Participants<br>attend a workshop aimed at normalizing failure\, where coaches help them identify<br>their academic diculties and work on goal-setting and time management skills.<br>Using a difference-in-discontinuity design\, we show that the program raises students'<br>first-year GPA and decreases first-year dropout rates. Effects are concentrated<br>among low-income students\, who also experience significant increases in their 6-year<br>graduation rate and earnings 6-9 years following entry to the university. Our findings<br>indicate that targeted group coaching can be an effective way to improve marginal<br>students' college success.<br><br>See you there!<br>Arthur</html-blob><br><html-blob><br></html-blob><br><html-blob>Hi there\,<br><br>Arthur Campbell is inviting you to a scheduled Zoom meeting.<br><br>Time: Apr 13\, 2022 12:00 PM Canberra\, Melbourne\, Sydney<br>Join from a PC\, Mac\, iPad\, iPhone or Android device:<br><br>&nbsp\; &nbsp\; Please click this URL to start or join.&nbsp\;<a href="[signup link removed]">[signup link removed]>87807759384?pwd=<wbr>YXoyZWxxeWFsblVJVGRzWmdOUTE4QT<wbr>09</a><br>&nbsp\; &nbsp\; Or\, go to&nbsp\;<a href="[signup link removed]">[signup link removed]>&nbsp\;and enter meeting ID: 878 0775 9384 &nbsp\;and passcode: 988559<br>&nbsp\; &nbsp\; &nbsp\; &nbsp\; Ensure your device has a dedicated microphone and webcam.<br>&nbsp\; &nbsp\; &nbsp\; &nbsp\; **Please do not share these details with those not on the participant list**<br><br>&nbsp\;<br>Join from a dial-in phone:<br><br>&nbsp\; &nbsp\; Dial: +61 3 990 59666 [+61 3 9905 ZOOM] or +61 2 8015 2088<br>&nbsp\; &nbsp\; Meeting ID: 878 0775 9384<br>&nbsp\; &nbsp\; International numbers available:&nbsp\;<a href="[signup link removed]">[signup link removed]>kkGKJOmP</a><br><br><br>Join from a Video capable room system(H.323/SIP):<br><br>Dial:<br>&nbsp\; &nbsp\; 61262227588 (From within Monash only)<br>&nbsp\; or:<br>&nbsp\; &nbsp\; 103.122.166.55 (IP) or<br>&nbsp\; &nbsp\;&nbsp\;<a href="http://zmau.us/">zmau.us</a>&nbsp\;(Backup)<br><br>&nbsp\; &nbsp\; Meeting ID: 878 0775 9384<br>&nbsp\; &nbsp\; Passcode: 988559<br></html-blob>

We reconcile these patterns in a general equilibrium model\, which features the endogenous interaction of hours\, wages\, and firm size. In the model\, workers willing to work longer hours sort into larger firms that offer a wage premium. Complementarities in hours generate wage penalties that increase with the distance from average firm hours. We use the model to argue the importance of the interaction between hours\, wages\, and firm size for inequality and firm policy.<br><u></u><br><b>Seminar Zoom Link</b><br><a href="[signup link removed]">[signup link removed]><br>Meeting ID &nbsp\; 867 3503 2062<br>Passcode &nbsp\;750630<br><br><u></u><br><u></u><u></u><u></u></html-blob>

Krusell\, Ohanian\, R´ios-Rull\, and Violante (2000) show that a model with capital-skill complementarity mechanism matches the data well and can account for changes in wage inequality in the 1963–1992 period. We show that applying the model to the 1963–2016 period delivers a good fit for the skill premium\; however\, it does not match the declining pattern in labor share in the last two decades. We modify the model to allow for a flexible technology structure and show that the degree of capital-skill complementarity is declining over time. The augmented model with time-varying capital-skill complementarity suggests explanations for the declining labor share.<br><br><u></u><b>Seminar Zoom Link</b><br><a href="[signup link removed]">[signup link removed]><br>Meeting ID &nbsp\; 867 3503 2062<br>Passcode &nbsp\;750630<br><br><u></u><u></u><u></u></html-blob>

We show existence of a Markov Perfect Equilibrium (MPE). We therefore offer a positive answer to a long-standing problem of existence of time-consistent economic policies in macroeconomics. Building upon these analytical methods\, we construct a computational algorithm. We perform several numerical exercises to explore the dynamics of real economic aggregates\, the debt-to-GDP ratio\, and the sovereign bond spread. Some central quantitative findings in the literature are not robust to changes in distortionary taxation and the debt haircut.<br></html-blob><br><html-blob><u></u><br><b>Seminar and One-on-One Meeting Zoom Link</b><br><a href="[signup link removed]">[signup link removed]><br>Meeting ID &nbsp\; 867 3503 2062<br>Passcode &nbsp\;750630<br><br><br><u></u></html-blob>

SUMMARY:Applied/CDES Seminar - Paul Burke (ANU) - In Person (Clayton)
LOCATION:Clayton\, Building 6\, Room 317
DESCRIPTION:<br><b>Title:</b>&nbsp\;Extreme temperatures\, mortality\, and adaptation: Evidence from the county level in China<br><br><b>Abstract:&nbsp\;</b>Extreme temperatures are known to cause adverse health outcomes. Yet knowledge on the magnitude of this effect in developing countries is limited due to data availability and reliability issues. Collecting data for 2\,872 counties in China\, we estimate the effects of daily temperatures on the monthly mortality rate. The results indicate that an additional day for which the maximum temperature exceeds 38°C on average increases the monthly mortality rate by about 1.7% relative to if that day’s maximum temperature had been in the range 16–21°C. This is after deducting deaths brought forward from the subsequent month. Higher gross domestic product per capita at the county level is associated with lower mortality effects of hot and cold days. Improved dwelling conditions are found to be associated with a lower mortality effect of hot days and improved local healthcare infrastructure to be associated with a lower mortality effect of cold days. In the absence of adaptation efforts\, the estimates suggest net upward pressure on mortality rates over coming decades in some counties\, especially under more extreme climate change scenarios.

Slemrod\, U. of Michigan)<br><b>Abstract:</b> We provide a unified analysis of taxation and taxpayer education when individuals have an incomplete understanding of a complex tax system. The analysis is independent of whether income is earned legitimately\, or by avoiding or evading taxes. In this sense\, learning about tax minimization strategies (tax manipulation) is isomorphic to learning about tax rates. The government in our model balances a trade-off: A better understanding of the tax system potentially allows taxpayers to optimize more effectively\, but also affects government revenue. Optimal taxpayer education and the optimal amount of redistribution can both be characterized by aggregate sufficient statistics\, which do not require information about how biases or behavioral responses vary across the decision margins. We provide similarly simple rules for how tax rates on different income-generating activities should be set relative to each other.

SUMMARY:Applied/CDES Seminar - Sonia Bhalotra Antidepressant Use and School Academic Achievement (with Meltem Daysal and Mircea Trandafir)
LOCATION:Clayton Campus LTB G53
DESCRIPTION:<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp\;We investigate impacts of antidepressant treatment on academic achievement among Danish children who are referred to a child psychiatrist. Leveraging conditional random assignment of patients to psychiatrists with different prescribing tendencies\, we find that treatment significantly increases test scores\, particularly in math. We show that the increase in test scores is meaningful in terms of its projected impact on income and contact with the police. Treatment effects are larger among children of less educated mothers who\, in general\, are less likely to be treated\, indicating negative selection on gains based on observables. However\, there is positive selection on gains based on unobservables. Further analysis of marginal treatment effects and policy simulations for the test score outcome indicate under-prescribing. In view of controversy over the side effects of antidepressants in children\, we investigate emergency room visits<br><br>The seminar will be at 11:00-12:15 in&nbsp\;<b>Clayton LTB G53</b>&nbsp\;(<a href="[signup link removed]">Zoom link here</a>)

We formulate a dynamic general equilibrium search model in which agents can trade by auction or negotiation\, with both mechanisms featuring two-sided incomplete information. We apply the model to housing transaction data\, using an estimated structural auction model to recover key model primitives used in solving the dynamic equilibrium steady-state parameters. The results highlight the importance of information and efficiency in interpreting the influence of search frictions\, with estimated seller search costs at negotiation that are 48% lower under complete information Nash bargaining than under incomplete information. We use the estimated model to investigate the effects of information disclosure regulations that require one side of the market to reveal information about their private valuation. </span><u></u><span> </span><br>If you want to meet Aaron\, please sign up for the <a href="[signup link removed]" class="pastedDriveLink-0">schedule</a>. We encourage Ph.D. students to meet our seminar speakers. <br>A buffet lunch will be provided from 1:15 to 2 pm at the department kitchen area.

First\, a large portion of mean wage differences across<br>occupations reflects differences in mean life cycle wage growth across occupations. Second\, occupations<br>that feature higher mean life cycle wage growth tend to experience a higher increase in cross-sectional<br>wage dispersion over the life cycle. That is\, differences in mean life cycle wage growth differences across<br>occupations are driven by higher order moments of the life cycle wage distribution for older individuals\;<br>occupations with high mean life cycle wage growth tend to have a small mass of individuals who earn<br>very high wages when old. These patterns hold for both males and females.<br>In the second part of the paper\, we present and estimate a simple two-occupation life cycle model that<br>features learning by doing. We show that it can account for the key features of the data that we<br>document even when the only source of comparative advantage in the model is with respect to learning<br>ability across occupations. A key feature of our estimates is that the variance of learning ability is much<br>greater in the high wage occupation than in the low wage occupation\, though mean learning ability is<br>modestly higher in the low wage occupation. Importantly\, our estimates imply large selection effects<br>with regard to life cycle wage growth across occupations. That is\, although the observed life cycle wage<br>growth for individuals is much greater in the high wage occupation\, a randomly chosen individual from<br>the low wage occupation will not achieve this rate of wage growth if switched into the high wage<br>occupation.<br>In the third part of the paper\, we use our estimated model to carry out counterfactuals to assess how<br>changes in the occupational employment structure affect overall inequality. A key finding is that mean<br>occupational wages do not provide useful guidance for inferring the effects of changes in the<br>employment distribution on overall wage inequality.

Identifying and Eliminating Potentially Harmful Monitoring Practices</p><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In a large German bakery chain\, many workers report negative perceptions of monitoring via checklists and other paperwork. We survey workers and managers about the value and time costs to different forms of monitoring\, and randomly remove two of the most perceivedly time-consuming and low-value forms in half of stores. Sales increase by 2-3% and store manager attrition substantially decreases. Mystery shopping indicates this occurs without a rise in workplace problems. Beneficial effects are fully concentrated in stores where regional managers predict that the treatment will be effective\, reflecting substantial heterogeneity in returns that is well-understood by these upper managers. Effects appear not to come from workers having more time for production\, but rather indirectly\, with surveys suggesting improvements in employee trust and commitment. As a result of the RCT\, the firm implemented firm-wide reductions in monitoring\, eliminating a checklist that employees regard as demeaning\, but keeping a checklist that helps coordinate production.</p>

LOCATION:CA_Building H\, Room H921
DESCRIPTION:<p><b>Title:</b> Unbundling Labor (with Simon Mongey)<u></u><u></u></p><p> <u></u><u></u></p><p><b>Abstract:</b> This paper presents two new facts on changes in occupational skill requirements and wage inequality in US data and develops a theoretical framework to interpret these facts. First\, we show that low-skill occupations have become more similar to one another in terms of skill requirements while high-skill occupations have become more different from one another. Second\, we show that residual wage inequality has fallen within low-skill occupations but has risen within high-skill occupations. Our model\, a generalization of Rosen (1983) and Heckman and Scheinkman (1987)\, shows how these facts are naturally linked. Heterogeneous workers supply an <i>indivisible bundle</i> of skills when they choose an occupation. In equilibrium\, a given skill can command a premium in occupations that are relatively intensive in its use. As occupations become more similar in their skill requirements\, the rents earned by workers with high comparative advantage in the skills hitherto most intensively used in that occupation are competed away\, decreasing within-occupation wage inequality. Likewise\, as occupations become more different in skill requirements\, workers with high comparative advantage in intensively used skills earn even larger rents\, increasing within-occupation wage inequality. We also document a number of other facts consistent with our framework: relative decreases in low-skill occupation hours premia and experience premia\, and increased occupational mobility.</p>

We develop a model that captures the link between firms' product and labour market competition to study effects of their market power.

Creators respond to platforms' decisions by individually choosing to supply content designed along a broad-niche spectrum\, which involves a trade-off between viewership size and per-viewer revenue. These changes create a trade-off between the platform's advertising revenue and transaction commission revenue. In amonopoly platform benchmark\, moving from pure discovery to hybrid always increases platform revenue while making content weakly more niche. However\, moving from pure membership to hybrid may reduce platform revenue if providing advertising is not sufficiently lucrative. In a duopoly setup\, these tradeoffs can change dramatically depending on the level of platform competition and homing behavior of creators and consumers.</p><p><br></p><p>If you want to meet Tat-How\, please sign up for the <a href="[signup link removed]">meeting schedule</a>.

DESCRIPTION:<br>"On the Emergence of International Currencies: Experimental Evidence." (with Yaroslav Rosokha and Marcos Cardozo)<br><br><br><br><br><p>Abstract: We integrate theory and experimental evidence to study the emergence of different international monetary arrangements based on the circulation of two intrinsically worthless fiat currencies as media of exchange. Our framework is based a simple two-country\, two-currency  search model where the value of each currency is jointly determined from private agents' decisions and   monetary policy formalized as changes in a country's money growth rate. We interpret the dynamics of acceptance patterns and inflation from the laboratory through the lens of an evolutionary learning model and show how the emergence of international currency depends on monetary policy and relative inflation rates.</p>

This suggests that climate goals can be met with smaller policy interventions. However\, if there are multiple equilibria\, radical and more ambitious climate policies are needed to shift the economy from a high-emissions to a low-emissions path. Once the radical shift has taken place the transformative policies can be withdrawn. More generally\, such policies can set in motion social\, technological\, and political tipping points. The rationale for such policies is strengthened due to key households\, corporations and institutions being at the centre of networks\, and thus radical climate policies should identify those agents and leverage them. The proposals offer a complementary perspective to scholars that have emphasised insights from the literature on early warning signals to advocate sensitive intervention points to get more effective and more transformative climate policies.</p>

Her current research agenda is focused on understanding the role of AI\, remote work\, affirmative action\, and other gender-based labor policies on women's labor market outcomes and on the effects of mental health and substance abuse legislation on mortality.</span></p><p><span>Time: Tuesday April 4 from 12:15 pm to 1:15 pm</span></p><p>Location: Building 6 level 3 room 317\, Clayton</p><br><br><b>Title:</b> Going Beyond the Mean: How Gender Affects the Distribution of Evaluations and How the Distribution of Evaluations Affects Hiring Decisions<br><br><b>Abstract</b> (really summary\, since the project is ongoing): In this project we show that women receive substantially different distributions of evaluations compared to men in an application evaluation environment and study how this impacts hiring outcomes. Specifically\, we show that women receive evaluations with higher variance\, larger range\, and lower minimums compared to men\, but only when the gender of the applicant is known to the evaluators. We are now designing a survey and a field experiment to understand how these distributional aspects of evaluations affect hiring decisions and whether knowing the gender of the applicants affects how these distributional aspects are interpreted.<br><br> We are hoping to get feedback on whether people think the topic is interesting\, if there is any related literature people think we should look into\, and what things we should dig into in the survey and field experiment.<br><br>If you want to join the seminar via zoom meeting\, here is the link:<br><a href="[signup link removed]"><u>[signup link removed]></a><br>    Or\, go to <a href="[signup link removed]"><u>[signup link removed]></a> and enter meeting ID: 535 143 9213 and passcode: 283411<br><br>Look forward to seeing you then.<br>Zhijun

DESCRIPTION:<p>The speaker for our next IO/Applied Theory Seminar isprofessor <a href="https://www.nisvanerkal.net/">Nisvan Erkal</a> from the University of Melbourne. Nisvan is a fellow of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_of_the_Social_Sciences_in_Australia">Academy of the Social Sciences inAustralia</a>. She has studied a range of subjects including the effect ofpolicies like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China%27s_One_Child_Policy">China's OneChild Policy</a> and how the use of information and traditional methodsof choosing leaders can result in discrimination against women. Herresearch papers are published in leading economics journals including <i>AmericanEconomic Review</i> and the <i>Rand Journal of Economics</i> among others. </p><p>Here is the detailed information:</p><p>Time: Thursday\, 6 April<b> </b>from<b> </b>2:00– 3:30pm</p><p>Place: H 4.87\, Caulfield</p><p><b>Title</b>: Sharing Bad News with Rivals<br>(with Guillem Roig University of Rosario).<br><b>Abstract</b>: Timely disclosure of discoveries in the researchprocess is crucial for efficiency. We consider strategic disclosure of researchoutcomes in an environment with two risky research projects in which competingfirms have private learning and private actions. We assume firms start researchon different projects and discover whether a project is feasible (positiveresult) or a dead-end (negative result). While positive results are alwaysdisclosed\, negative results may not be. The disclosure of negative results hastwo effects. In addition to revealing to the rival that the project the firmwas working on was a dead-end\, it also reveals to the rival the researchstrategy of the firm making the disclosure. Knowing which project the firm isworking on changes the rival's learning process\, and as a result\, the rival mayabandon research more quickly. We find that efficient firms share negativeresults if they arrive sufficiently early. Inefficient firms never sharenegative results. These results have implications for when we may expect to seeinefficiencies arising from negative results being kept secret.</p><p>If you want to meet Nisvan\, please sign up the <a href="[signup link removed]">meeting schedule</a>.

SUMMARY:Applied Micro / CDES Seminar - Ryan Edwards (ANU)
LOCATION:Building 6\, level 3\, room 317\, Clayton Campus
DESCRIPTION:<b>Fight Fire with Finance: a Randomized Field Experiment to Curtail Land-Clearing Fire in Indonesia</b><br><br><p></p><p>This paper presents a randomized evaluation of collective pay-for-performance payments for ecosystem services. We test whether community-level fiscal incentives can curtail the use of land clearing fire\, a major source of emissions and negative health externalities\, in a critical low regulation setting. The program was implemented over the 2018 fire season in Indonesia as a three-part bundle: (a) awareness raising and training on fire prevention\, (b) a small capital grant to mobilize fire fighting resources\, and (c) the promise of a large conditional cash transfer at the end of the year if the village does not have fire\, which we monitor by satellite. While program villages increase fire prevention efforts\, we find no evidence of any large or statistically significant differences in fire outcomes. The null result is likely driven by a combination of the payment not being large enough and collective action failure\, and offers a cautionary tale on the importance of carefully measuring additionality when evaluating payments for environmental services and otherconservation programs.</p><p> </p><p>Zoom link: <a href="[signup link removed]">[signup link removed]></p>

His research aims at understanding the determinants of democratic stability and providing insights into what economic\, technological\, and political factors increase the viability of liberal democratic institutions in the long run. He focuses on the role of the state bureaucracy and its relation with politics and citizens\, and the management and transmission of information in a context of increasing media pluralism. His research contributes to the design of democratic institutions capable to withstand negative economic and social shocks\, and his papers are published in top economic journals including the <i>American Economic Review</i> and <i>Review of Economic Studies.</i> Please visit his homepage for detailed information about his research: <a href="https://www.gratton.org/">https://www.gratton.org/</a></p><p> </p><p>Here are the details for his seminar:</p><p>Time: Thursday May 4<sup>th</sup> from 2:00 to 3:30 pm</p><p>Location: Building 317\, Room 6\, Clayton</p><p>Title of Presentation: <a href="https://www.gratton.org/papers/DrainTheSwamp.pdf">Drain the Swamp: A Theory of Anti-Elite Populism (with BartonE. Lee)</a></p><p>Abstract: We study a model of popular demand for anti-elite populist reforms that drain the swamp: replace experienced public servants with novices that will only acquire experience with time. Voters benefit from experienced public servants because they are more effective at delivering public goods and more competent at detecting emergency threats. However\, public servants’ policy preferences do not always align with those of voters. This trade-off produces two key forces in our model: public servants’ incompetence spurs disagreement between them and voters\, and their effectiveness grants them more power to dictate policy. Both of these effects fuel mistrust between voters and public servants\, sometimes inducing voters to drain the swamp in cycles of anti-elite populism. We study which factors can sustain a responsive democracy or induce a technocracy. When instead populism arises\, we discuss which reforms may reduce the frequency of populist cycles.</p><p>If you want to meet Gabriele\, please sign up for the <a href="[signup link removed]" class="pastedDriveLink-0">meeting schedule</a>.

DESCRIPTION:<b>Title:</b> Agriculture’s Nitrogen Legacy (with Konstantinos Metaxoglou)<br><b><br></b><br><b>Abstract: </b><span>Nitrogen pollution of waterways is a large global problem\, especially in regions with intensive </span><span>cropland agriculture such as the Mississippi River Basin that drains 40% of the continental </span><span>United States. In contrast to prior studies\, which mostly apply agronomic and hydrologic </span><span>models\, we collect detailed data from water quality monitors and use panel data econometric </span><span>methods to estimate how land use affects nitrogen pollution. We find a strong positive effect of corn acreage on nitrogen concentration in nearby streams and rivers that is an order </span><span>of magnitude smaller than those implied by the agronomic and hydrologic models. Our findings are consistent with a new line of research documenting accumulation of large amounts </span><span>of nitrogen in subsurface soil and groundwater over several decades\; this is excess nitrogen </span><span>that was applied to fields but has yet to appear in waterways. This legacy nitrogen will eventually leach into streams and rivers exacerbating further nutrient pollution. In the presence of </span><span>large amounts of legacy nitrogen\, land retirement and other on-farm mitigation policies are </span><span>uneconomic. Downstream off-farm practices\, such as the creation and restoration of fluvial </span><span>wetlands\, which can remove both legacy and new nitrogen\, however\, are cost-effective.</span>

LOCATION:CA_Building H\, Room H901
DESCRIPTION:<br>Colleagues\, <br>  The next Applied Theory/IO seminar is scheduled on Thursday May 25th\, and the speaker is Dr. <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/kellyneill?pli=1">Kelly Neill</a> from the University of Sydney. <br>  Kelly got her Ph.D. from Rice University in 2022 and currently she is a lecturer in the school of economics at the University of Sydney. She is also a non-resident scholar at the Centre for Energy Studies at Rice University. <br>  Kelly's research interests are empirical IO and energy economics\, with a focus on natural gas markets. She has studied how electricity and gas markets interact\, vertical integration of gas retailers\, and the consequences of restricting gas exports. <br>  Here is the detailed information about the seminar:<br><br>Date and time: Thursday May 25 from 2 pm to 3:30 pm<br>Location: Room 901\, building H\, Caulfield <br>Title of presentation: <b>Market Power and Vertical Integration in Australia's Natural Gas Network</b><br><p><u></u> <b>Abstract:</b> I study competition in Australia’s wholesale natural gas markets\, where three large firms trade at four locations in a pipeline network. The firms are vertically-integrated\, with both shipping and retail operations. Using conditions for profit-maximising bids between hubs\, I estimate each firm’s retail demand\, their net trading positions\, and mark-ups. I can also estimate each firm’s marginal costs without any restrictions on the functional form. This facilitates an investigation of the costs of pipeline congestion and storage\, as well as the effect of new entrants on competition.</p><br> <br>If you want to meet Kelly\, please sign up for the <a href="[signup link removed]" class="pastedDriveLink-0">meeting schedule</a>.

SUMMARY:Applied Micro / CDES Seminar - Federico Masera (UNSW)
LOCATION:CA_Building H\, Room H902
DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Federico Masera (UNSW)<br> <br>Title: The Long Civil War: White Casualties and Anti-Black Racism in the US South <br> <p><span>The Civil War (1861-1865) was a pivotal moment for race relations in the US South. In its aftermath\, Northern occupation of the South enforced the policies of Reconstruction that ended slavery and introduced new rights for Black Americans. With the withdrawal of Northern occupation (1877)\, many white Southerners used violence against Black Americans to reestablish and maintain white supremacy for generations. We argue that communities that were more heavily affected by the Civil War felt more threatened by the promise of an interracial democracy\, amplifying incentives to uphold racially discriminatory laws and institutions. To test this argument\, we construct a new dataset on the universe of soldiers enlisted in the Confederate army and their war experience. Exploiting within-state variation\, we show that in cities with a larger share of soldiers exposed to deadly battles there is greater support for racially conservative parties and discriminatory laws\, and more lynchings of Black men.<span> </span>These effects begin immediately after the withdrawal of Northern occupation and persist throughout the following 100 years.<u></u> <u></u></span></p><b><a href="[signup link removed]">Zoom</a></b><br><font><br></font>

Using a unique daily panel\, we find that both the platform owner and third-party sellers base pricing on past sales\, but only the owner exploits competitors’ sales data. We estimate a price competition model with heterogeneous seller learning. We find that (1) eliminating the owner’s access to competitors’ data increases social welfare by 0.33%\, negatively impacting the owner through reduced first-party sales and (2) providing third-party sellers with equal access<br>to competitors’ data as the owner increases social welfare by 1.65%\, benefiting the owner through increased referral fees and yielding a Pareto improvement.<br>The working paper is attached.<br>  If you want to join the seminar via zoom meeting\, here is the link: <a href="[signup link removed]">[signup link removed]> <br>   Or\, go to <a href="[signup link removed]">[signup link removed]> and enter meeting ID: 535 143 9213  and passcode: 283411<br>  As usual\, a buffet lunch will be provided from 1 pm on Thursday.

DESCRIPTION:<p><b>Title</b>: “Learning from Unreliable Information”<u></u><u></u></p><p><u></u> <u></u></p><p><b>Abstract</b>: “We study whether individuals can learn the reliability of their information source through social learning. We revisit the classic sequential social learning model\, where agents arrive in order and make decisions based on the past actions of others and their private signals. However\, the reliability of the common signal-generating process remains uncertain. We show that the achievement of learning in this setting is not guaranteed\, and it depends crucially on the relative tail distributions between the uninformative and informative signals. We identify the phenomenon of perpetual disagreement as the cause of learning and provide a characterization of learning in the canonical Gaussian environment.”</p>

DESCRIPTION:<u>Title: Productivity and Quality of Multi-product Firms</u><br><u><br></u><br><u>Abstract:</u> This paper proposes a novel method to estimate productivity and quality of multi-product firms at the firm-product level\, together with transformation function and demand parameters. The method relies on firm optimization conditions to obtain a one-to-one mapping between observed data and unobserved productivity and quality. It has the advantage of allowing for heterogeneous unobserved intermediate input prices and scalability to handle many products\, without imputing firm-product input shares or relying on productivity evolution. We apply this method to a set of Mexican manufacturing industries. We find that multi-product firms' better-performing products have both higher productivity and higher quality\, with the former emerging as a stronger predictor of within-firm performance. However\, firms face a trade-off between quality and productivity\, which we refer to as the cost of quality. The cost of quality is higher for more differentiated products and declines with product age. In a counterfactual exercise\, we show that a reduction in the cost of quality can lead to substantial firm-level productivity gains and that\, on average\, about 30.3 percent of these gains are due to the within-firm reallocation of production. Notably\, a larger product scope allows more room for intra-firm resource reallocation\, leading to higher productivity gains. This reveals a new mechanism for enhancing the performance of multi-product firms.<u><br></u>

DESCRIPTION:<br><b>Title:</b> Asymmetric Information Sharing in Oligopoly: A Natural Experiment in Retail Gasoline<br><br><b>Abstract</b>: Using a natural experiment from a retail gasoline antitrust case\, we study how asymmetric information sharing affects oligopoly pricing. Empirically\, price competition softens when\, following case settlement\, information sharing shifts from symmetric to asymmetric\, with one firm losing access to high-frequency\, granular rival price data. We provide theory and empirics illustrating how strategic ignorance creates price commitment\, leading to higher price-cost margins. Using a structural model\, we quantify the impact of asymmetric information sharing on firms' profits\, finding substantial profit-enhancing effects. These results provide a cautionary tale for antitrust agencies regarding the potential unintended consequences of limiting price information sharing.

Consumers infer the commonly-valued quality of a good from the<br>quantity demanded and price paid by others. When consumers exaggerate the similarity between<br>their and others’ tastes\, such “taste projection” leads to discrepant quality perceptions across<br>consumers. A projector’s (mis)inferred quality is negatively related to their taste and increasing<br>in the observed price. These biased beliefs generate an excessively elastic market demand. We<br>also analyze dynamic monopoly pricing with short-lived taste-projecting consumers. Optimal<br>pricing follows a declining path: the seller uses a high price early to inflate future buyers’<br>perceptions\, and then lowers it gradually to induce over-adoption.

Players first<br>choose their social network\, where having a greater number of partners brings benefits.<br>Subsequently\, they decide whether to provide a public bad that yields benefits to themselves but<br>imposes costs on the entire society. In the event of providing the public bad\, there is a small<br>chance of being detected and subsequently punished. In our proposed responsibility-sharing<br>mechanism\, if a player is detected providing the public bad\, all their partners also face<br>punishment. Both the theoretical analysis and experimental results strongly support the<br>effectiveness of this mechanism in inducing socially desirable outcomes. Furthermore\, in an<br>additional experimental treatment\, we find that the mechanism is less effective when the<br>undesirable behavior is private information\, despite players having the option to voluntarily<br>disclose such information. Our findings have important policy implications. In designing<br>strategies to combat undesirable behavior\, it is beneficial to implement shared responsibility<br>within local social networks.

SUMMARY:[MIG] Macro Seminar: Guillaume Rocheteau (Host: Ayushi)
LOCATION:H 9. 14 caulfield
DESCRIPTION:<br><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/grochete/home?authuser=0">Guillaume Rocheteau</a> will present <i>Inflation and Unemployment in the Long Run Revisited</i>.<br><br>Abstract: <br>We construct a continuous-time\, monetary model with frictional goods and labor markets to revisit<br>the long-run relationship between inflation and unemployment. Relative to the literature (e.g.\, Berentsen<br>et al.\, 2011)\, we endogenize the value of consumers’ outside options and firms’ market power and show<br>they depend on the inflation rate. As trading frictions vanish\, markups and markdowns go to zero. The<br>long-run Phillips curve is generically U-shaped\, i.e.\, at low inflation rates\, an increase in anticipated<br>inflation reduces the unemployment rate whereas at high inflation rates it raises it. The Friedman rule<br>is also suboptimal for welfare when firms’ bargaining power in either labor or goods market is too low.

SUMMARY:BET Seminar - Sergey Gavrilets (University of Tennessee)
LOCATION:Room 317\, Building 6\, Clayton Campus
DESCRIPTION:BET Seminar - Sergey Gavrilets (University of Tennessee\, Knoxville)<br>Location: Room 317\, Building 6<br>Time: 12:15-1:30<br><br>Paper: Co-evolution of behavior and beliefs in social dilemmas: estimating material\, social\, cognitive and cultural determinants<br>Zoom Link:<br>Please click this URL to start or join. <a href="[signup link removed]">[signup link removed]><br>Or\, go to <a href="[signup link removed]">[signup link removed]>and enter meeting ID: 823 3897 3515  and passcode: 898424 <br><br>Abstract:<br><br>Understanding and predicting human cooperative behavior and beliefs dynamics remain a major challenge both from the scientific and practical perspectives. Because of the complexity and multiplicity of material\, social and cognitive factors involved both empirical and theoretical work tend to focus only on some snippets of the puzzle. Recently\, a mathematical theory has been proposed that integrates material\, social\, and cognitive aspects of behavior and beliefs dynamics in social dilemmas within heterogeneous groups. Here we validate and apply this theory in different cultural contexts through four long-term behavioral experiments utilizing the Common Pool Resources game and the Collective Risk game. Our results show that material considerations carry the smallest weight in decision-making\, while personal norms tend to be the most important factor. Empirical and normative expectations have intermediate weights in decision-making. Cognitive dissonance\, social projection\, logic constraints\, and cultural background play important roles in both decision-making and beliefs dynamics. At the individual level\, we observe differences in the weights people assign to factors involved in the decision-making and beliefs updating process. We identify different types of prosociality and rule-following associated with cultural differences\, various channels for the effects of messaging\, and culturally-dependent interactions between sensitivity to messaging and conformity. Our results can put policy and information  design on firmer grounds\, highlighting the need for interventions tailored to the situation at hand and to individual characteristics.

SUMMARY:Brown bag Seminar-Clayton: Tommaso Sartori
LOCATION:Room 317 Building 6
DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Tommaso Sartori<br><p>Title: Beyond Test Scores: How Being the Top of Your Class Affects Educational Attainments and Socioemotional Development.</p><p>Abstract:  Making comparisons is key to our understanding of the world. In education\, grouping children will inevitably make them notice differences and similarities between themselves. As academic performance is easily perceived\, students will manage to rank themselves based on that. While ranking highly within your class or grade consistently showed a large impact on future test scores\, why that happens is still unclear. Because the main hypotheses are linked to either improvement in self-efficacy or motivation\, it is key to understand whether a rank effect on socioemotional skills exists. To answer this question\, we follow 5 cohorts of children born in the city of Aberdeen (Scotland) throughout their primary school career. Detailed information on their classroom behavior is also collected. We build ranks using a standardized test taken at 9 years of age\, finding a large and positive rank effect on academic performance. Ranking 3 to 4 positions higher increases the 11-plus Test scores by up to 6% of a unit of standard deviation. More importantly\, we find that a similar difference in rank improves internalizing skills by up to 5% of a unit of standard deviation. Internalizing skills are linked to children's perception of themselves\, as well as their ability to exploit their ability to achieve their goals. We argue that the improvements in self-efficacy spurring from a higher rank are behind the substantial rank effect on academic performance.</p><br><br><br>  Please click this URL to start or join. <a href="[signup link removed]"><u>[signup link removed]></a><br>    Or\, go to <a href="[signup link removed]"><u>[signup link removed]></a> and enter meeting ID: 535 143 9213 and passcode: 283411<br>        Ensure your device has a dedicated microphone and webcam.

DESCRIPTION:"Strategic Yet Not Demanding: The Empirical Reach of Oligopoly with CES Preferences”. The project is joint with J. Peter Neary.<br> <br>Here is the abstract:<br>We consider the behavior of heterogeneous firms in oligopolistic markets when preferences are CES. We provide an explicit characterization of the implied demand manifold\, a smooth curve representing the demand function in the space of the elasticity and curvature of demand. We show that Bertrand and Cournot competition with nested CES preferences imply the same demand manifold\, but equilibrium location on the manifold depends on conduct. Through the demand manifold\, we identify how Betrand competition with CES is more restrictive in terms of predicted passthrough than Cournot competition with CES. The demand manifold also highlights testable predictions on the elasticity-curvature relationship which can be used to discriminate between monopolistic competition with variable elasticity demands and oligopoly with CES demands.<br><br><table dir="ltr"><colgroup><col /></colgroup><tbody><tr><td><u><a href="[signup link removed]" target="_blank">Join Zoom Meeting</a></u></td></tr><tr><td><u>843 6797 3125</u></td></tr><tr><td><u>132822</u></td></tr></tbody></table>

DESCRIPTION:"Firm-to-firm Price Rigidity within a Network" (with Álvaro Castillo\, Luis Felipe Cespedes\, and Javier Turen)\n\nAbstract\n\nThis paper uses unique administrative data on firm-to-firm transaction prices at the supplier-client-product level for the Chilean economy for the period 2017m12-2023m6. The granularity of the data allows us to explore the determinants of price rigidity within firm-to-firm relationships. We investigate the role of firm size\, market share\, and non-pricing factors on pricing strategies. We document that larger suppliers\, suppliers selling more products\, and suppliers selling a product to more customers\, adjust prices more frequently and in smaller magnitudes. These facts highlight economies of scope to price management. We also observe that suppliers with larger product market shares change prices more frequently and in larger magnitudes\, which could imply the presence of market power. We split the sample into pre-2020m6 and post-2020m6 to study potential differences between low-inflation and high-inflation periods. The large firms effects hold only in the high-inflation period but we do not observe an increased importance of suppliers' market share. We also highlight the impact of non-pricing factors\, such as the duration of supplier-client relationships. Given that large firms in our sample are also star suppliers\, and the main suppliers of large clients\, our results have important implications for the transmission of monetary policy.

DESCRIPTION:Dear all\,<br><br>Please join us for our upcoming CDES seminar\, presented by A/Prof. Jason Kerwin of the University of Minnesota \, who will speak about &quot\;Navigating Ambiguity: Imprecise Probabilities and the Updating of Disease Risk Beliefs&quot\; (with Divya Pandey)<br><br><b>Abstract</b>:<br>Probabilistic risk beliefs are key drivers of economic and health decisions\, but people are not always certain about their beliefs. We study these &quot\;imprecise probabilities&quot\;\, also known as ambiguous beliefs. Imprecision is measurable separately from the level of risk beliefs\, and higher imprecision leads to more updating of beliefs in response to a randomized information treatment. New information also causes changes in imprecision levels. We can map our data onto both a standard Bayesian model and a version that is designed to handle imprecise probabilities\; these models match some features of our data but not all of them. Imprecise probabilities have important implications for our under-standing of decision-making and for the design of programs intended to change people’s minds.<br><br>Jason will also be available for <b>one-on-one meetings during the day.</b><br>Please sign up to a timeslot <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XGcJnd44E6C6rPNSdoSxEGTLVC7GLBNEqrrrmf5e5zA/edit%23gid%3D0&amp\;sa=D&amp\;source=calendar&amp\;ust=1712966913575574&amp\;usg=AOvVaw1CXK8NIUkUzbMoWfA_49nr" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>Please note: a separate group meeting for PhD students has been enabled at 12-12:45 pm in H.907 and a separate invitation has been sent.<br><br>We have also enabled a <b>Zoom </b>option for those who cannot physically attend the seminar (details below).<br><br>Looking forward to seeing you all there!<br><br>Time: Apr 24\, 2024 03:00 PM Canberra\, Melbourne\, Sydney <br>Join from a PC\, Mac\, iPad\, iPhone or Android device: <br><br>    Please click this URL to start or join. <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://monash.zoom.us/j/87607993188?pwd%3DUUtLR0t6Z205VnBCUDVrQXErTkhGdz09&amp\;sa=D&amp\;source=calendar&amp\;ust=1712966913575574&amp\;usg=AOvVaw24GjJnief1JyKguA1KXXyy" target="_blank">[signup link removed]> <br>    Or\, go to <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://monash.zoom.us/join&amp\;sa=D&amp\;source=calendar&amp\;ust=1712966913575574&amp\;usg=AOvVaw2GhNALT56T8H2XvE1z5yE2" target="_blank">[signup link removed]> and enter meeting ID: 876 0799 3188  and passcode: 094820<br>        Ensure your device has a dedicated microphone and webcam.<br>        **Please do not share these details with those not on the participant list**<br><br> <br>Join from a dial-in phone: <br><br>    Dial: +61 3 990 59666 [+61 3 9905 ZOOM] or +61 2 8015 2088<br>    Meeting ID: 876 0799 3188 <br>    International numbers available: <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://monash.zoom.us/u/k9Ae6HAsb&amp\;sa=D&amp\;source=calendar&amp\;ust=1712966913575574&amp\;usg=AOvVaw2-8KqsyVA3A7JSGDS0TKPs" target="_blank">[signup link removed]> <br><br><br>Join from a Video capable room system(H.323/SIP): <br><br>Dial:<br>    61262227588 (From within Monash only) <br>  or:<br>    103.122.166.55 (IP) or<br>    <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://zmau.us&amp\;sa=D&amp\;source=calendar&amp\;ust=1712966913575574&amp\;usg=AOvVaw0pYGGdp1MrnrHFuCOTDyQ4" target="_blank">zmau.us</a> (Backup)<br><br>    Meeting ID: 876 0799 3188 <br>    Passcode: 094820<br><br><br>============================================<br>Use of Zoom is subject to Monash University’s IT Acceptable Use Policy\, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://publicpolicydms.monash.edu/Monash/documents/1909268&amp\;sa=D&amp\;source=calendar&amp\;ust=1712966913575574&amp\;usg=AOvVaw0cfszTxceVscdDbdstw5Nn" target="_blank">https://publicpolicydms.monash.edu/Monash/documents/1909268</a><br> <br>For information relating to the handling of your personal information please refer to Monash University’s Data Protection and Privacy Procedure\, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.monash.edu/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/790086/Privacy.pdf&amp\;sa=D&amp\;source=calendar&amp\;ust=1712966913575574&amp\;usg=AOvVaw0nhsY3LAuGj21S9d-DFrT4" target="_blank">https://www.monash.edu/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/790086/Privacy.pdf</a><br> <br>If you have any questions about how Monash University is collecting and handling your personal information\, please contact our Data Protection and Privacy Office at <a href="mailto:dataprotectionofficer@monash.edu" target="_blank">dataprotectionofficer@monash.edu</a>.<br>============================================

This study investigates how early unequal task allocations emerge and the impact of unequal task assignments on career progression. We collect survey\, experimental\, and administrative data from cohorts of MBA students graduating from the Norwegian School of Economics before and after they enter the labor market and follow their career trajectories. Results show that as early as 1 year after entering the labor market\, gender differences in task allocations emerge with women more than men reporting that they perform more non-promotable tasks than their peers. This is not driven by men and women initially wanting or expecting different things from work\, or from selection into different industries\, firms\, or occupations. It is a result that is stronger in male-dominated sectors and which seems to be driven by gendered expectations of who will perform NPTs\, consistent with prior findings (Babcock et al 2017).

SUMMARY:OASIS Seminar: Phil McCalman (UoM)
DESCRIPTION:<br><br>FDI screening by host governments: Who bears the cost?<br><br>Countries are increasingly screening foreign direct investment to ensure it is aligned with criteria such as the national interest or national security. Each investment is reviewed on a case by case basis to allow flexibility in implementation. However\, a lack of explicit criteria for evaluating policy and a broad scope for imposing mitigation measures on investments\, creates additional uncertainty for foreign investors. We examine the Australian screening regime to quantify the costs associated for investments that are reviewed. We find that screening imposes an economy wide loss of approximately 20% of the surplus that would be created by the foreign investment. This cost is five times greater than that imposed by impediments to goods trade. There are also important dynamic considerations\, with foreign ownership of an Australian firm introducing frictions to subsequent domestic acquisitions. We also find all these costs are predominantly imposed on the Australian economy with some evidence of international spillovers with Chinese investors bearing part of the cost.<br><br><b><br>Zoom details:</b><br><a href="[signup link removed]" target="_blank"><u><u>[signup link removed] />82208726196?pwd=<wbr />bk41QW5jd1IrZytSN1Y1UHpBbXZCZz<wbr />09</u></u></a><br><br>    Meeting ID: 822 0872 6196<br>    Password: 924358

DESCRIPTION:<blockquote><p>Title: Cross-Market Platform Competition in Mobile App Economy</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Abstract: The mobile app economy comprises two distinct platform markets through which app developers make revenue: app platform and ad platform markets. App sales are facilitated by app platforms\, whereas advertising matching is intermediated by ad platforms. Cross-market platform competition exists\, i.e.\, app and ad platforms compete for developers' revenue sources to earn commissions. In literature and policy debates\, however\, these platform markets are studied separately. The goal of this study is development of a unified model to examine them jointly. The results provide novel implications for competition policy\, which could not be reached without consideration for cross-market platform competition.<br></p></blockquote><p> </p><br>Speaker: Yusuke Zennyo<br>Please click this URL to start or join. <a href="[signup link removed]" target="_blank"><u>[signup link removed]></a><br>    Or\, go to <a href="[signup link removed]" target="_blank"><u>[signup link removed]></a> and enter meeting ID: 535 143 9213 and passcode: 283411<br>        Ensure your device has a dedicated microphone and webcam.

This paper presents a quantitative framework for characterizing the equilibrium evolution of national boundaries in a world with a rich geography. The framework delivers simple equilibrium conditions based on the efficient transportation of resources that arise from disparate political economic micro-foundations. I characterize the existence\, uniqueness\, and efficiency of the equilibrium and provide a simple algorithm for its calculation. When combined with detailed spatial geography data from Europe\, the equilibrium conditions well approximate observed borders\, and the framework is able to successfully predict the evolution of national boundaries and resulting conflict over the past millennia. Finally\, I apply the framework to ask how the changing spatial distribution of resources arising from climate change may alter European borders in the future\, finding that the Crimean peninsula and surrounding area is especially susceptible.<br><br>Hope to see you there!<br><br><b>Zoom details: </b><br><table><colgroup><col /></colgroup><tbody><tr><td><br></td></tr></tbody></table><table dir="ltr"><colgroup><col /></colgroup><tbody><tr><td><u><a href="[signup link removed]" target="_blank">Join Zoom Meeting</a></u></td></tr><tr><td>                               227 055 6760</td></tr><tr><td>7811813</td></tr></tbody></table>

SUMMARY:OASIS Seminar: Tom Zylkin (University of Richmond)
DESCRIPTION:<p>Dear all\,<br><br>Ournext OASIS speaker is <a href="https://www.tomzylkin.com/">TomZylkin</a>.It will be next Wednesday\, May 22\, 9 am AEST.<br><br><br>Title:"Bootstrap forGravity Models" <br><br>Theabstract is: Istudy the use of bootstrap-based bias corrections in two-way and three-wayfixed effects models with unknown heteroskedasticity\, focusing on gravitymodels used in international trade. I show that the distribution of bootstrapestimates both replicates the asymptotic bias of the original estimator andalso can provide a less biased estimate of the standard errors. Bootstrapmethods therefore offer the potential to improve inferences along two differentmargins using a single procedure. However\, in practice\, only the traditionalre-sampling bootstrap performs favorably at both of these tasks. The fractionalweight bootstrap\, in particular\, performs poorly and should be avoided. I alsoverify that computationally efficient approximations of the bootstrap deliversatisfactory results. Because implementing the bootstrap procedure in principleonly requires knowledge of the sampling process (i.e\, how the data is“clustered”)\, it provides a potential remedy for situations in which analyticaland/or jackknife-based bias corrections are not available. Leading examplesinclude panel data gravity models with time trends\, pooled gravity models formulti-sector data\, and imputation-based estimators for aggregatingheterogeneous treatment effects.<br><br><br>Hope to see you there!</p>\n\nJoin Zoom Meeting\n[signup link removed] (ID: 89984038195\, passcode: 060207)\n\nJoin by phone\n(US) +1 877-369-0926 (passcode: 060207)\n\nJoin using SIP\n89984038195@global.zoomcrc.com (passcode: 060207)\n\nJoining instructions: https://www.google.com/url?q=https://applications.zoom.us/addon/invitation/detail?meetingUuid%3DAi6CsRwBQnaEFcxjgz8z8A%253D%253D%26signature%3D19a4412d01c34d2f846ad8df78fa64287902317e01ff91887ad78d572e39105d%26v%3D1&sa=D&source=calendar&usg=AOvVaw2D8_4lsBZVz4UfAdq_2ck6\n\nMeeting host: <a href="mailto:Laura.Puzzello@monash.edu" target="_blank">Laura.Puzzello@monash.edu</a><br /><br />Join Zoom Meeting: <br /><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://monash.zoom.us/j/89984038195?pwd%3DVmR3QWlmQTBvbktkV3VrNlNKVHZ5dz09&amp\;sa=D&amp\;source=calendar&amp\;usg=AOvVaw2dp-peRzOGx--H9qe2aY6r" target="_blank">[signup link removed]>

DESCRIPTION:Please join us for this Brown Bag seminar with A/Prof. Arya Gaduh from the University of Arkansas<br><br><b>Does Technology Complement Teachers? Experimental Evidence from Indonesian Public Secondary Schools</b><br><b><br></b><br>Students in low- and middle-income countries often complete formal secondary school lacking foundational mathematics skills\, let alone higher-order skills. Poor foundational skills at primary school combined with teachers’ inadequate training to teach higher-order skills exacerbate this learning gap. We evaluate the impact of a complementary suite of interventions for students to strengthen weak foundations and improve higher-order skills in mathematics in Indonesia’s public secondary schools. We deployed a locally contextualized computer-adaptive learning software to directly teach students foundational skills\; and trained teachers on pedagogical techniques to improve higher-order skills. The first treatment arm (HTO) consisted of only the software\, while the second treatment arm (HTHT) combined the software with the training. The software was implemented during regular school hours\, designed to take up to 40\\% of mathematics class hours. After nine months\, we find that neither treatment arm affected students&#39\; foundational skills. However\, HTHT positively impacted students&#39\; higher-order skills by 0.05 standard deviations\, equivalent to one-third of a school year. The effects are isolated to below-average students: we find positive (negative) impacts on their foundational skills taught by below- (above-)median teachers. These results offer a cautionary tale on the interaction between learning technologies and teacher skills to produce heterogeneous learning outcomes.<br><br>Lunch will be provided.

We find that 1960s-born CEOs pay more attention to inflation than other cohorts. Attentive CEOs adopt cautious policies –- holding more cash\, investing less\, hiring less\, and using less leverage. Moreover\, they tend to raise output prices and exhibit higher equity valuations. Our results are robust to excluding the COVID-19 period. Our analysis highlights how CEO experience and attention shape corporate decisions and performance in response to the macroeconomic environment.<br><br>Zoom link: <br> Please click this URL to start or join. <a href="[signup link removed]" target="_blank"><u>[signup link removed]></a>     Or\, go to <a href="[signup link removed]" target="_blank"><u>[signup link removed]></a> and enter meeting ID: 535 143 9213  and passcode: 283411

DESCRIPTION:Please join us for the next Brown Bag seminar\, presented by A/Prof Shamma Alam from Dickinson College\, who is visiting the CDES from 8 July-9 August.<br><br><b>Title: </b>Are Asset Transfers the Solution for Health Challenges of the Extreme Poor? Evidence from a Randomized Control Trial in Bangladesh<br><b><br></b><br><b>Abstract</b><br><p>We examine the impact of an asset transfer program\, Targeting the Ultra Poor (TUP)\, on women’s health outcomes\, health-seeking behavior\, health-related behavior\, and health knowledge in Bangladesh. The TUP is an integrated program that combines the transfer of income-generating assets\, entrepreneurship training\, health information\, and access to latrines for women in extreme poor households. Using data from a randomized control trial over four years\, we find significant improvements in women’s health following program intervention: women in TUP program\, especially prime-age adults\, are significantly more likely to experience an increase in body mass index (BMI) and less likely to experience illness that affects work. We analyze the channels through which the program affects health outcomes. There is a significant income effect as the consumption of nutritious food\, such as fruit\, fish\, and meat increases. Women were also more likely to visit doctors instead of trying to self-treat following an illness. There was also improved hygiene practices like the use of latrines\, and a partial improvement in health knowledge.</p><p> </p><p>Lunch provided.</p><p>Zoom option available for those who cannot attend:</p><p>Time: Aug 7\, 2024 12:00 PM Canberra\, Melbourne\, Sydney <br>Join from a PC\, Mac\, iPad\, iPhone or Android device: <br><br>    Please click this URL to start or join. <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://monash.zoom.us/j/83457795486?pwd%3DfywkQfXgbUbOFF5fPIoAntXVXmXa6T.1&amp\;sa=D&amp\;source=calendar&amp\;ust=1722048182742892&amp\;usg=AOvVaw3zr2ldTkl1lTYp_LbDU7bD" target="_blank">[signup link removed]> <br>    Or\, go to <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://monash.zoom.us/join&amp\;sa=D&amp\;source=calendar&amp\;ust=1722048182742892&amp\;usg=AOvVaw2113ihFz_LIKodBi35luKR" target="_blank">[signup link removed]> and enter meeting ID: 834 5779 5486  and passcode: 893712<br>        Ensure your device has a dedicated microphone and webcam.<br>        **Please do not share these details with those not on the participant list**<br><br> <br>Join from a dial-in phone: <br><br>    Dial: +61 3 990 59666 [+61 3 9905 ZOOM] or +61 2 8015 2088<br>    Meeting ID: 834 5779 5486 <br>    International numbers available: <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://monash.zoom.us/u/kcSsonQIOY&amp\;sa=D&amp\;source=calendar&amp\;ust=1722048182742892&amp\;usg=AOvVaw0tybMA4geg5Gsj7FKMoUxn" target="_blank">[signup link removed]> <br><br><br>Join from a Video capable room system(H.323/SIP): <br><br>Dial:<br>    61262227588 (From within Monash only) <br>  or:<br>    103.122.166.55 (IP) or<br>    <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://zmau.us&amp\;sa=D&amp\;source=calendar&amp\;ust=1722048182742892&amp\;usg=AOvVaw0DspTXftZNkoJ8hTQZuH4e" target="_blank">zmau.us</a> (Backup)<br><br>    Meeting ID: 834 5779 5486 <br>    Passcode: 893712<br><br><br>============================================<br>Use of Zoom is subject to Monash University’s IT Acceptable Use Policy\, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://publicpolicydms.monash.edu/Monash/documents/1909268&amp\;sa=D&amp\;source=calendar&amp\;ust=1722048182742892&amp\;usg=AOvVaw3EaxaSHwxhQlvLPG-aS5x3" target="_blank">https://publicpolicydms.monash.edu/Monash/documents/1909268</a><br> <br>For information relating to the handling of your personal information please refer to Monash University’s Data Protection and Privacy Procedure\, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.monash.edu/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/790086/Privacy.pdf&amp\;sa=D&amp\;source=calendar&amp\;ust=1722048182742892&amp\;usg=AOvVaw0YwhmMw1CVgh2ZLQTjUgxg" target="_blank">https://www.monash.edu/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/790086/Privacy.pdf</a><br> <br>If you have any questions about how Monash University is collecting and handling your personal information\, please contact our Data Protection and Privacy Office at <a href="mailto:dataprotectionofficer@monash.edu" target="_blank">dataprotectionofficer@monash.edu</a>.<br>============================================<br></p><br><p> </p><br><b><br></b>

SUMMARY:Brown bag Seminar-Clayton: Dan McGee
LOCATION:Room 317 Building 6
DESCRIPTION:<br>Title: An Economic Theory of Implicit Bias<br>Abstract: I study the economic basis of implicit bias in a segregated society. Implicit biases create impulses to discriminate against an outgroup. However\, individuals may reconsider these impulses if given sufficient incentive to do so. These biases evolve over time in response to agents' experiences: good outcomes yield positive associations and bad outcomes yield negative associations. If agents learn exclusively from their own experiences\, gradual learning yields approximately optimal behaviour: agents hold positive implicit associations exactly when discriminating is costly to welfare. However\, this result reverses under segregation\; when agents gain implicit associations from the media and have fewer personal interactions\, they can arrive at an implicit prejudice\, no matter how positive are their personal experiences. I test this framework on a decade of Implicit Association Test data\, finding that segregation worsens implicit biases and homogenizes Whites' view of racial outgroups.<br><br>Zoom meeting link:<br>Please click this URL to start or join. <a href="[signup link removed]" target="_blank"><u>[signup link removed]></a><br>    Or\, go to <a href="[signup link removed]" target="_blank"><u>[signup link removed]></a> and enter meeting ID: 535 143 9213 and passcode: 283411

Fueled by rising direct-to-consumer trade\, these “de minimis” shipments have exploded yet are not recorded in Census trade data. Who benefits from this type of trade\, and what are the policy implications? We analyze international shipment data\, including de minimis shipments\, from three global carriers and US Customs and Border Protection. Lower-income zip codes are more likely to import de minimis shipments\, particularly from China\, suggesting that the tariff and administrative fee incidence in direct-to-consumer trade is pro-poor. Theoretically\, imposing tariffs above a threshold leads to terms-of-trade gains through bunching\, even in a setting with complete pass-through to linear tariffs. Empirically\, bunching pins down the demand elasticity for direct shipments. Eliminating §321 would reduce aggregate welfare by $11.8-$14.3 billion and disproportionately hurt lower-income and minority consumers.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><br>Join Zoom Meeting <a href="[signup link removed]" target="_blank"><u><u>[signup link removed]></u></a> <br>Meeting ID: 982 6141 8614 <br>Passcode: 11813

LOCATION:H907-Conference Room (BusEco)
DESCRIPTION:Please join us for our next Brown Bag Seminar\, presented by Dr. Hemant Pullabhotla from Deakin University.<br><b><br></b><br><b>Title</b>: Spilling Over: The Benefits of Public Works Projects for Groundwater in India(joint work with Patrick Behrer\, World Bank)<br><br><b>Abstract</b><br>Depletion of groundwater is a major challenge in India. We examine how a major rural public works program (MNREGA) that financed the construction of surface water infrastructure that may have plausibly increased aquifer recharge rates impacted groundwater levels. Using a difference-in-differences approach on the staggered and heterogeneous roll-out of MNREGA\, we show that groundwater levels increased after its implementation. These increases were concentrated in states that constructed the largest number of MNREGA-financed surface water projects. The increases we observe in groundwater appear to have led to increases in the irrigated area of high value crops and greater overall irrigation during the dry season.<b><br></b><br><br>Lunch provided.<br><br>Zoom details for those who cannot join in person:<br><br>Time: Aug 14\, 2024 12:00 PM Canberra\, Melbourne\, Sydney <br>Join from a PC\, Mac\, iPad\, iPhone or Android device: <br><br>    Please click this URL to start or join. <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://monash.zoom.us/j/88693275240?pwd%3DPl0GpUbxAOzkRXV8WTwegv7fhnm453.1&amp\;sa=D&amp\;source=calendar&amp\;ust=1722048956299796&amp\;usg=AOvVaw1T0laDeBfUP8ermyzdil_L" target="_blank">[signup link removed]> <br>    Or\, go to <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://monash.zoom.us/join&amp\;sa=D&amp\;source=calendar&amp\;ust=1722048956299796&amp\;usg=AOvVaw3r2HmOKdOR4Px_lwcMproc" target="_blank">[signup link removed]> and enter meeting ID: 886 9327 5240  and passcode: 847925<br>        Ensure your device has a dedicated microphone and webcam.<br>        **Please do not share these details with those not on the participant list**<br><br> <br>Join from a dial-in phone: <br><br>    Dial: +61 3 990 59666 [+61 3 9905 ZOOM] or +61 2 8015 2088<br>    Meeting ID: 886 9327 5240 <br>    International numbers available: <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://monash.zoom.us/u/kbElgMudu3&amp\;sa=D&amp\;source=calendar&amp\;ust=1722048956299796&amp\;usg=AOvVaw3VIPjEZlLm99oqBomFABPp" target="_blank">[signup link removed]> <br><br><br>Join from a Video capable room system(H.323/SIP): <br><br>Dial:<br>    61262227588 (From within Monash only) <br>  or:<br>    103.122.166.55 (IP) or<br>    <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://zmau.us&amp\;sa=D&amp\;source=calendar&amp\;ust=1722048956299796&amp\;usg=AOvVaw1j-fZYEan5YPk99-1oL1Qk" target="_blank">zmau.us</a> (Backup)<br><br>    Meeting ID: 886 9327 5240 <br>    Passcode: 847925<br><br><br>============================================<br>Use of Zoom is subject to Monash University’s IT Acceptable Use Policy\, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://publicpolicydms.monash.edu/Monash/documents/1909268&amp\;sa=D&amp\;source=calendar&amp\;ust=1722048956299796&amp\;usg=AOvVaw2ssQZ4TP4KPwRhdkkMwev-" target="_blank">https://publicpolicydms.monash.edu/Monash/documents/1909268</a><br> <br>For information relating to the handling of your personal information please refer to Monash University’s Data Protection and Privacy Procedure\, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.monash.edu/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/790086/Privacy.pdf&amp\;sa=D&amp\;source=calendar&amp\;ust=1722048956299796&amp\;usg=AOvVaw0PMwOc9XBWSF6vdHlj2JCu" target="_blank">https://www.monash.edu/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/790086/Privacy.pdf</a><br> <br>If you have any questions about how Monash University is collecting and handling your personal information\, please contact our Data Protection and Privacy Office at <a href="mailto:dataprotectionofficer@monash.edu" target="_blank">dataprotectionofficer@monash.edu</a>.<br>============================================

LOCATION:Online
DESCRIPTION:ZOOM option: [signup link removed]"Knowledge Suppression and Resilience under Censorship"\n\nYing Bai (CUHK)\, Ruixue Jia (UCSD)\, Jiaojiao Yang (CUHK)\n\nThis study examines the short-\, medium-\, and long-term effects of state censorship on knowledge production\, centering on the largest-scale book banning in Chinese history instigated by the creation of Siku Quanshu (Complete Library in Four Sections) during 1772--1783. Analyzing annual publication data of over 161\,000 titles from the 1660s to the 1940s\, we find that categories subject to more severe bans experienced a significant decrease in publications in the decades following the bans (1780s to 1840s). Yet\, as the grip of state control loosened from the 1840s to the 1940s\, there was a pronounced revival in the publication of books in categories that had been previously restricted. Further text analysis reveals notable spillover effects on less sensitive books within the same category as the banned ones\, indicating a chilling effect and associated self-censorship. We also document self-censorship behaviors among publishers and authors and find that the exit and entry decisions of publishers help explain both the suppression and subsequent revival of knowledge production.

DESCRIPTION:ZOOM option: [signup link removed] ID: 885 314 92854\nPassword: 516147\n\nTitle: The Party and the Firm\n\nAbstract: This project documents the measurement\, causes and consequences of the Chinese Communist Party's influence on firms in China over the last two decades. We first propose novel quantitative measures of Party-state influence on firms using machine learning and present recent trends in those measures. Consistent with qualitative accounts\, we find a recent increase in Party-state influence. While domestic private and foreign firms tend to exhibit mostly rhetorical influence\, state-owned firms also exhibit behavioral influence. We further document that Party-state influence serves as a tool of political control in areas prone to social instability\, partly explaining the increases in influence. Finally\, while Party-state influence on average has small economic effects on firms\, our evidence suggests that it may lead to economic distortions.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Tax Policy\, Marketing\, and Growth of Young Manufacturing Firms: Evidence from a Tax Incentive Policy\n\nAbstract: The life cycle of firms features young firms as smaller and having lower profitability than mature ones\, yet the growth of young firms is imperative for the dynamic growth of industries. Using a pretax deduction policy reform in China that reduces marketing costs for qualified young firms\, this paper investigates the effect of marketing and tax incentives on the growth of young manufacturing firms. The findings show that the tax reform incentivized qualified young firms to invest substantially more in marketing\, which improved the demand of their products and profitability. The increased demand also induced more investment in R&D due to complementarity. A counterfactual based on a structural model of the effects of firms' dynamic decisions on marketing and R&D investments demonstrates that the impact is quantitatively substantial. The pretax deduction policy increases the marketing expenses ratio of qualified young firms by 1.75 percentage points (a 46 percent increase) on average. In the long run\, this increases their demand factor\, productivity\, and profitability by 22\, 0.4\, and 16 percent\, respetively. Overall\, the paper finds that the age-based performance gap between young and mature firms is mainly driven by demand-side differences rather than productivity\, as premised in the literature. Young firms have lower demand but similar or even higher productivity relative to mature ones\, and their demand grows gradually as they invest more in marketing.

SUMMARY:Brown bag seminar-Caulfield
LOCATION:H487
DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Filip Premik.\n \n\nTitle: The Costs of Variety: About Productivity of Differentiated Inputs\n\n \n\nAbstract: This paper studies heterogeneity in capital production input. In many markets\, goods of the same purpose but different make are used as intermediate inputs in producing final goods or services. Such input differentiation may generate significant complementarities in the production process by making it less productive when the set of inputs is more heterogeneous. We investigate the costs resulting from input differentiation using unique data on urban bus fleets. We identify the key factors driving input heterogeneity and are first to provide causal evidence on efficiency gains from unifying units within the capital input. Specifically\, the same bus is more utilized in a fleet with a higher share of similar buses than in a fleet composed of substantially different buses by up to 10%. Moreover\, the same bus requires fewer units of labor to deliver the same output. \n\n \n\nThere will be pizza in the room for those attending. A Zoom link will be sent next week along with the reminder.

The method assumes a successful retail shop must 1) attract customers\, 2) source and stock inventory\, and 3) choose the right mix of products from the right suppliers. Our method estimates the productivity of a shop across all three dimensions. We apply our method to a novel retail-specific dataset collected through high frequency surveys of a sample of independent retailers in Lusaka\, Zambia. Our results suggest the dimensions of productivity are correlated but also contain substantial independent variation. An entrepreneur can be highly productive in one aspect of running a shop but unproductive in others. Under these conditions\, our model predicts that standard estimators would yield deeply misleading results. Policy interventions based on those estimators could actually lower social welfare.<br><br><br>Asha Sundaram is inviting you to a scheduled Zoom meeting.<br><br>Topic: OASIS Seminar: Brenda Samaniego\, UC Santa Cruz<br>Time: Oct 16\, 2024 11:00 AM Canberra\, Melbourne\, Sydney<br><br>Join Zoom Meeting<br><a href="[signup link removed]" target="_blank"><u>[signup link removed]></a><br><br>Meeting ID: 915 7332 8973<br>Passcode: 811813

Peace negotiations often become deadlocked due to difficulties in identifying mutually advantageous agreements. A large-scale survey task and method is developed to identify the strength of preference for components of potential peace deals and changes to the status quo. Analyzing pre-October 7 representative samples of Israelis and Palestinians reveals a Zone of Possible Agreement\, demonstrating shared preferences for deals that improve daily life. Violence exposure hampers compromise among Israelis\, emphasizing the importance of abstaining from violence for conflict resolution. The method has implications for conflict resolution and negotiations of all kinds.<br><br>If you prefer to join via zoom meeting\, please click this URL to start or join. <a href="[signup link removed]" target="_blank">[signup link removed] />6202626641?pwd=<wbr />blUycDZydHNENzZNayt5R29RdnNlZz<wbr />09</a><br><br>    Or\, go to <a href="[signup link removed]" target="_blank">[signup link removed]> and enter meeting ID: 620 262 6641  and passcode: 707968

The study was designed to test whether lay provider–led group-based interpersonal therapy for adolescents could be effectively scaled up using modest resources in a low-income country. It also tested whether a lump-sum cash transfer offered at the end of therapy provided any additional benefit. The findings show that group-based interpersonal therapy increased the share of adolescents with minimal depression by 20-30 percent 12 months after therapy\, but these effects dissipated by the 24-month follow-up. Small short-term effects on human capital accumulation were also not sustained at 24 months. Surprisingly\, the marginal effect of providing cash transfers to group-based interpersonal therapy beneficiaries on mental health was large and negative\, persisting two years after baseline. The paper provides suggestive evidence that the adolescents were frustrated by their inability to use the cash toward their own goals because of the need to divert funds toward the essential needs of their families during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p><br>A light lunch will be served afterwards.<br><br>Berk will also be available for one-on-one meetings on 22-23 October.

DESCRIPTION:ZOOM option: [signup link removed] ID: 885 314 92854\nPassword: 516147\n\nLearning About Outgroups: The Impact of Broad Versus Deep Interactions (with Anujit Chakraborty\, Arkadev Ghosh\, and Gareth Nellis)\n\nWe hypothesize that broad contact\, involving brief interactions with multiple outgroup members\, and deep contact\, meaning longer interactions with a single outgroup member\, play distinct roles in shaping intergroup relations. We set up a factory in India and recruited Hindu and Muslim men to work in pairs on joint production tasks. We randomly assigned participants to work either with the same ingroup or outgroup partner daily (deep contact)\, a different outgroup partner each day (broad contact)\, or to a control group. While deep contact strengthens social and economic ties with the outgroup partner interacted with\, only broad contact reduces misperceptions about outgroup strangers. These findings align with a model in which independent sampling (observing multiple outgroup members) promotes learning about outgroups more than prolonged interaction with a single individual does. Nevertheless\, neither type of contact changes behavior toward the wider outgroup.

LOCATION:Building 6\, level 3\, room 317\, Clayton Campus
DESCRIPTION:ZOOM option: [signup link removed] ID: 885 314 92854\nPassword: 516147\n\nPaper title: From Gridlock to Polarization (joint with Marc Jacob and Gabriele Gratton)\n\nAbstract:\nWe propose a mechanism linking legislative gridlock to voters’ support for candidates who hold extreme policy positions. Moderate voters rationally discount extreme policy proposals from co-partisans on gridlocked policy issues because on these issues policy change is unlikely. We test our mechanism in a large-scale online experiment in which we randomly vary subjects’ perceptions of gridlock and measure subjects’ support for co-partisan candidates in candidate-choice tasks. We verify that greater perception of gridlock on a specific issue increases moderate subjects’ propensity to vote for extreme co-partisan candidates on the gridlocked issue. We show that our experimental evidence is consistent with our mechanism and that other mechanisms are less likely to underlie our main result. Our theory offers a causal connection from gridlock to elite polarization that may inform further empirical work and suggests a novel tradeoff between elite polarization and policy stability in constitutional design.

Exploiting data on firms’ “auxiliary” establishments\, we develop a novel measure of proprietary in-house knowledge and show that it is associated with increased growth and industry switching. We rationalize this reallocation in a model where firms combine physical and knowledge inputs as complements\, and where producing the latter in-house confers a sector-neutral productivity advantage facilitating within-firm structural transformation.

DESCRIPTION:ZOOM option: [signup link removed] ID: 885 314 92854\nPassword: 516147\n\nTitle: Adapting for scale: Experimental evidence on computer-aided instruction in India (with Karthik Muralidharan (UCSD))\n\nAbstract: The promise of ‘evidence-based policy’ for improving human welfare is belied by growing evidence that interventions found to ‘work’ in small-scale efficacy trials often fail at scale. We study the scaling of a personalized adaptive learning (PAL) software that was highly effective in a small-scale trial. We adapt the PAL software implementation for scalability\, and experimentally evaluate this adaptation in a more representative sample over 20 times larger than the original study. The scaled intervention continued to be highly effective. Treated students scored 0.22 standard deviations (s.d.) and 0.2 s.d. higher in Mathematics and Hindi after 18 months\, a 50-66% increase in productivity over the control group. We show that student time logged on the PAL platform strongly correlates with learning gains\, providing a low-cost proxy measure of implementation quality for future scale-ups. The adaptation was highly cost effective\, and has several features that make it scalable across diverse settings.

DESCRIPTION:Dear all\,<br><br>Our next OASIS seminar will be by <b>Emanuel Ornelas</b>\, Sao Paulo School of Economics on <b>Wednesday 20 November at <u>9 am</u> Melbourne time</b>.  <br><br>The title and abstract of Emanuel's talk\, and Zoom details follow.<br><br>See you all there!<br><br><br><br>Title: Equilibrium Trade Regimes: Power- vs. Rules-Based<br><br>We propose a simple dynamic model of the international trading system. Relying on premises drawn from the Hegemonic Stability Theory in international relations\, we study the sustainability of a rules-based trade regime when there is power asymmetry\, the leading country has the prerogative to choose the regime\, and the identity of the leading country changes over time. In a many-country\, infinite-horizon game\, we find that once a power-based regime is in place\, switching back to a rules-based system requires the existence of a hegemonic country -- i.e.\, one that is significantly more powerful than every other country. Moreover\, the conditions for the long-run sustainability of a rules-based regime require that the cost to establish it should be neither too small nor too large. These and other results indicate that the current deterioration of multilateral cooperation can have enduring negative consequences for the world.<br><br>Join Zoom Meeting<br><a href="[signup link removed]" target="_blank"><u>[signup link removed]></a><br><br>Meeting ID: 961 1975 7636<br>Passcode: 811813<br><br>---<br><br>One tap mobile<br>+6436590603\,\,96119757636# New Zealand<br>+6448860026\,\,96119757636# New Zealand<br><br>---<br><br>Dial by your location<br>• +64 3 659 0603 New Zealand<br>• +64 4 886 0026 New Zealand<br>• +64 9 884 6780 New Zealand<br><br>Meeting ID: 961 1975 7636<br><br>Find your local number: <a href="[signup link removed]" target="_blank"><u>[signup link removed]></a><br><br>---<br><br>Join by SIP<br>• <a href="mailto:96119757636@zoomcrc.com" target="_blank"><u>96119757636@zoomcrc.com</u></a><br><br>---<br><br>Join by H.323<br>• 162.255.37.11 (US West)<br>• 162.255.36.11 (US East)<br>• 115.114.131.7 (India Mumbai)<br>• 115.114.115.7 (India Hyderabad)<br>• 213.19.144.110 (Amsterdam Netherlands)<br>• 213.244.140.110 (Germany)<br>• 103.122.166.55 (Australia Sydney)<br>• 103.122.167.55 (Australia Melbourne)<br>• 149.137.40.110 (Singapore)<br>• 64.211.144.160 (Brazil)<br>• 159.124.132.243 (Mexico)<br>• 159.124.168.213 (Canada Toronto)<br>• 65.39.152.160 (Canada Vancouver)<br>• 207.226.132.110 (Japan Tokyo)<br>• 149.137.24.110 (Japan Osaka)<br><br>Meeting ID: 961 1975 7636<br>Passcode: 811813

By compiling a comprehensive dataset covering the universes of judges\, lawyers\, law firms\, litigants\, and lawsuits in China from 2014 to 2021\, we identify over 14\,000 judges who left their positions to practice as lawyers\, accounting for 6.6% (2.6%) of all judges (lawyers) nationwide. We report three main findings. First\, in otherwise identical lawsuits\, these revolving-door lawyers obtain significantly more favorable court decisions for their clients. Second\, leveraging within-lawyer variation in performances at home vs. away courts\, we show that the premium of revolving-door lawyers comes from both “know who” and “know how.” Third\, revolving-door lawyers create an efficiency-equity trade-off for society — on the one hand\, they present evidence and reasoning to help judges make more informed decisions\; on the other hand\, they use connections and strategic arguments to help their (affluent) clients\, thereby biasing judicial decisions and exacerbating socio-economic inequalities. We extend the theoretical framework of Dewatripont and Tirole (1999) to quantify these trade-offs.

We gather detailed survey data\, administrative records\, and data from a mobile phone app. The transfer caused total individual income excluding the transfers to fall by about $2\,000/year relative to the control group and a 3.9 percentage point decrease in labor market participation. Participants reduced their work hours as a result of the transfers by 1-2 hours/week and participants’ partners reduced their work hours by a comparable amount. Among other categories of time use\, the greatest increase generated by the transfer was in time spent on leisure. Despite asking detailed questions about amenities\, we find no impact on quality of employment\, and our confidence intervals can rule out even small improvements. We observe no significant effects on investments in human capital\, though younger participants may pursue more formal education. Overall\, our results suggest a moderate labor supply effect that does not appear offset by other productive activities.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Q.A. Do<br>Title: <span>Communities of Commerce: The Legacy of Chinese Immigration in Java (Quoc-Anh Do\, Sebastian Ellingsen\, Gedeon Lim)</span><br><br>Abstract: Ethnic minorities have played an out-sized role in both historical and contemporary economic development. This paper studies one of the most prominent but understudied cases\, in the world’s most populous island: the economic legacy of ethnic Chinese immigration on Java\, Indonesia in the early 21st century. Using an instrumental variables strategy\, we exploit plausibly arbitrary 15th-century ethnic Chinese landing sites on the Northern coast of Java that determined initial Chinese presence but have not been accessible by sea since the mid 17th-century due to silting. We find a strong positive effect on local economic development. In districts with higher ethnic Chinese shares\, villages are more developed as measured by consumption\, population density and nighttime light intensity. We trace this to the persistently important economic role of Chinese in trade and commerce. Districts with a historically higher ethnic Chinese share have\, today\, a higher (lower) employment share in services (agriculture)\, firms have higher sales and these positive effects can be traced to a larger financial industry. Furthermore\, we find that subsectors more closely linked to traditional ethnic Chinese sectors continue to employ a larger share of individuals. Our findings suggest that the ethnic Chinese minority in Indonesia\, despite their small size\, have and continue to play an out-sized role in Indonesia’s modern-day development with spillovers that benefit the entire local population.<br>Zoom link: <span> </span><a href="[signup link removed]" target="_blank"><u>[signup link removed]></a><span>     Or\, go to </span><a href="[signup link removed]" target="_blank"><u>[signup link removed]></a><span> and enter meeting ID: 535 143 9213  and passcode: 283411</span><br><span>Lunch will be provided at 1 pm\, in the staff lounge.</span>

We find that increases in worker eligibility for urban residence registration (Hukou) across origin-destination pairs increase rural-urban exports\, imports\, capital inflows and outflows\, both in terms of bilateral transaction values and the number of unique buyer-seller matches. To quantify the implications at the regional level\, we interpret these estimates through<br>the lens of a simple spatial equilibrium model in which migrants can lead to a reduction in bilateral<br>buyer-seller matching frictions. We find that a 10% increase in a rural county’s migration market access<br>leads to a 1.5% increase in the county’s trade market access and a 2.5% increase in investment market<br>access. In the context of China’s recent Hukou reforms\, we find that these additional gains in market<br>integration were on average larger among the urban destinations compared to the rural origins\,<br>reinforcing incentives for rural-urban migration.<br><br><br><b><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://unimelb.zoom.us/j/88466342374?pwd%3DRxxGeyr7btsmivNmLacknEYTCf0HdD.1&amp\;sa=D&amp\;source=calendar&amp\;ust=1741576568974686&amp\;usg=AOvVaw1gva-Z2N8qaw-ZveBwkYji" target="_blank"><u>Zoom link</u></a></b><br><br>Meeting ID: 88466342374<br>Password: 366777

DESCRIPTION:Title: Dual Misbeliefs and Technology Adoption: Evidence from Air Purifiers in Bangladesh\n\nAbstract: Dhaka\, Bangladesh\, consistently ranks as one of the world's most polluted cities\, yet fewer than 1% of middle-class households own an air purifier. Why don't these households\, who can afford air purifiers\, adopt them despite the extremely high levels of air pollution? We find that while indoor air is nearly as polluted as outdoor air\, households believe indoor air is much cleaner. Furthermore\, although air purifiers are highly effective at removing pollutants\, households are uncertain about their effectiveness. Consistent with these misbeliefs\, the average willingness to pay for an air purifier is less than a tenth of its retail cost. To address these misconceptions\, we conducted a multi-phase field experiment by providing air monitors and purifiers to households. Those receiving air monitors realized that their indoor air was more polluted than those without monitors\, but this did not increase their willingness to pay for purifiers. Similarly\, providing air purifiers reduced uncertainty about their effectiveness\, yet households seldom used them—even when compensated for electricity costs. However\, households that received both monitors and purifiers significantly increased both their usage and valuation of the purifiers. Our findings suggest that correcting misperceptions about both the severity of the problem and the effectiveness of the solution is necessary to boost the adoption and use of certain preventive health technologies.\n\n----( Video Call )----\n[signup link removed]

DESCRIPTION:Title: <span>Optimal Unemployment Insurance with Multiple Applications</span><br><span><br></span><br><span>Abstract: </span><span>This paper examines how unemployment transfers should be allocated over the business cycle. When risk-averse workers can submit multiple applications\, the optimal UI policy is countercyclical. In contrast\, optimal policy in a standard search model featuring one-to-one matching is procyclical. In the latter\, more generous UI during a downturn discourages search effort\, dampening job creation. In the former\, decreased search effort aids job creation. Because firms cannot coordinate and commit to not making the same worker an offer\, lower search effort by reducing the number of applications sent mitigates this coordination friction. This in turn boosts job creation incentives\, supporting employment outcomes.</span>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Speaker: Sarah Smith</p><p>Title: “Going back to the high schools”: Challenging stereotypes about economics<span> </span></p><p>Abstract:</p><p><u></u> <span>Students hold stereotyped beliefs about subjects that may distort subject choices. For example\, economics is associated with money\, but not with inequality or well-being\, and this may narrow its appeal. We report findings from a UK-wide high school outreach program in which undergraduate champions delivered economics taster sessions to 5\,000+ non-economics students in non-selective high schools (an under-represented group at undergraduate level). The sessions increase students’ reported likelihood of studying economics by 15 – 20 per cent\, slightly greater for the most disadvantaged students. The sessions broaden students’ understanding of what economics is about and change their beliefs about what it would be like to study economics. We estimate a structural model and show that\, for students choosing what to study in their final years of high school\, what matters most is a (change in) belief that they will do well\, while for students choosing what to study at university\, it is a (change in) belief that they will enjoy economics. Although the sessions provide earnings and career information – and change students’ beliefs about whether economics leads to a well-paid and enjoyable job – this is a less important channel\, with the exception of non-white students. A key take-away is that beliefs about non-pecuniary aspects of studying different subjects are key drivers of subject choice\, making it vital to challenge distortionary subject stereotypes.</span></p><p><span>Zoom link: </span></p><p> Please click this URL to start or join. <a href="[signup link removed]" target="_blank"><u>[signup link removed]></a> </p><p> Or\, go to <a href="[signup link removed]" target="_blank"><u>[signup link removed]></a> and enter meeting ID: 535 143 9213  and passcode: 283411<span></span></p><p><br></p><p><span><br></span></p>

DESCRIPTION:Title: Overkill\, Extinction\, and the Neolithic Revolution\n\nAbstract: This research explores the biogeographical origins of the emergence and spread of agriculture. The theory suggests that mammal species with certain biological traits were more vulnerable to hunting pressure\, leading to their extinction. This reduced hunting resources\, which in turn pushed humans toward agriculture. To test this hypothesis\, I create a measure that captures the loss of hunting resources due to extinction. By using various complementary datasets\, controlling for ancient climatic factors\, and leveraging certain biological traits that raise extinction risk as exogenous factors\, the research shows that the extinction of large herbivores significantly contributed to the Neolithic Revolution. Moreover\, I reconcile an apparent conflict with an existing extinct theory of the Neolithic Revolution by highlighting differences in conceptual frameworks\, empirical methods\, and findings. Empirical evidence shows that my theory more robustly explains the transition at finer spatial scales using panel variations.\n\n----( Video Call )----\n[signup link removed]

DESCRIPTION:Title: <span>Hours-Biased Technological Change</span><br><span><br></span><br><b>Abstract</b>:  While there is a long-term decline in average working hours\, in the cross-section hours have gone up for high-wage workers. This rise in hours inequality coincides with the well-documented increase in wage inequality. To jointly explain these facts\, I propose a matching model of the labor market in which hours worked are endogenous. Due to the income effect\, average hours decline. Yet\, technological change as measured by the complementarities between hours and ability can amplify or dampen sorting and inequality\, depending on the strength of the income effect relative to the complementarities in production. I estimate the model using US data to quantitatively analyze the impact of hours-biased technological change on income inequality. I find that the rising returns to long hours for skilled workers explains one quarter of the rise in wage inequality\, and accounts for the entire increase in the hours-wage correlation.<span></span>

DESCRIPTION:Title: <span>"Affirmative action in centralized admissions: effects on education equality" (with Ana Gazmuri) </span><br><br>Abstract: This paper studies the conditions for affirmative action policies in school admissions to effectively reduce socioeconomic (SES) inequalities in access to school. We examine a 2016 Chilean reform that centralized primary school applications\, eliminated selective admissions from private schools\, and introduced affirmative action for low-SES students. We analyze the reform's impact on educational inequalities through its sequential implementation. Puzzling\, our findings indicate that the reform did not materially reduce school segregation nor increase school quality for low-SES students. To understand this outcome\, we estimate a demand model using students' rank-ordered application lists. We allow for important heterogeneity in preferences in terms of both observables and unobservables. We discover significant demand heterogeneity across SES groups\, partly explaining why low- and high-SES students apply to different schools. Moreover\, students often rank too few schools\, limiting the reform's effectiveness by leaving many unassigned and ultimately enrolled in less desirable schools regardless of priority status. Our counterfactual results indicate that increasing the number of schools ranked could significantly improve outcomes for low-SES students and decrease the percentage of unassigned students that do not benefit from the reform.<br><br>Zoom link: <span>  Please click this URL to start or join.</span><span> </span><a href="[signup link removed]" target="_blank"><u>[signup link removed]></a><br>    Or\, go to <a href="[signup link removed]" target="_blank"><u>[signup link removed]></a> and enter meeting ID: 535 143 9213 and passcode: 283411

Evaluating the Tradeoffs of Location<br><br><u><b>Abstract</b>:</u> How does the location of affordable housing affect household welfare\, the distribution of assistance\, and broader societal objectives such as racial integration? Using administrative data on affordable housing tenants\, we first show that\, despite fixed eligibility requirements\, developments in higher-opportunity neighborhoods disproportionately house tenants who are higher income\, more educated\, less likely to have children\, and less likely to be Black or Hispanic. To quantify the welfare implications\, we build a model in which households choose from both market-rate and affordable housing options\, where the latter are rationed by private developers. Building in higher-opportunity neighborhoods costs more\, but increases household welfare and reduces racial and economic segregation. However\, the welfare gains accrue to more moderate-need and white (non-Hispanic) households at the expense of other households. Using the estimated model\, we show that the shift in the distribution of assistance is primarily due to a 'crowding out' effect: households that only apply for assistance in higher-opportunity neighborhoods crowd out those willing to apply regardless of location. Relative to the initial choice of location\, policy levers available post-construction—such as lowering the income limits used for means-testing—have only limited effects.

Economic research provided a compelling explanation. It showed that if governments maximize the well-being of their own countries broadly defined\, GATT/WTO principles would facilitate mutually beneficial cooperation over their trade policy choices. Now heightened geopolitical rivalry seems to have undermined the WTO. A simple transposition of the previous rationalization suggests that geopolitics and trade cooperation are not compatible. We show that this is only true if rivalry eclipses any consideration of own-country well-being. In all other circumstances\, there are gains from trade cooperation even with geopolitics. Furthermore\, the WTO’s relevance is in question only if it adheres too rigidly to its existing rules and norms. Through measured adaptation to the geopolitical imperative\, the WTO can continue to thrive as a forum for multilateral trade cooperation in the age of geopolitics.</p><br><b><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://unimelb.zoom.us/j/88466342374?pwd%3DRxxGeyr7btsmivNmLacknEYTCf0HdD.1&amp\;sa=D&amp\;source=calendar&amp\;ust=1745447581333679&amp\;usg=AOvVaw3_gUNx87PAiyO-55AU0q-d" target="_blank"><u><u>Zoom link</u></u></a></b><br><br><span>Meeting ID: 88466342374</span><br><span>Password: 366777<br></span>

DESCRIPTION:Title: HeforShe: Bargaining Power\, Parental Beliefs\, and Parental Investments\n\nAbstract: \nWe estimate a structural model of intra-household allocation of parental investments in children. We combine novel measures of verbal investments and beliefs about the returns to investment for both mothers and fathers with hyper-local variation in female bargaining power stemming from ancestral inheritance practices. Female bargaining power influences the quantity and quality of paternal investments. Specifically\, fathers speak more to children\, and in a more engaging way\, when women have more bargaining power\, but only when their wife expects investments to improve child language. Our results single out the role of economic power in mothers’ ability to elicit domain-specific paternal investment. Policy simulations show large increases in paternal investments from a female empowerment policy.\n\n----( Video Call )----\n[signup link removed]

LOCATION:H4.87 Caulfield
DESCRIPTION:<b>Title</b>: "Higher Education Policies and Spatial Inequality Across US States"<br><br><b>Abstract</b>:  To what extent have the federal and state higher education policies—which have affected the supply and demand of college education—contributed to the growing cross-state wage inequality since 1980? To address this question\, we develop and estimate a quantitative spatial model with endogenous college education and migration. The model features skill-biased technical changes and agglomeration effects\, which means that a state’s average wage rises as more residents attain college degrees or as college-educated workers migrate into the state. Counterfactual analyses reveal that tuition discounts and public appropriations by the federal and state governments have become more progressive. In the baseline\, the standard deviation of log mean wages across states increased from 0.087 in 1980 to 0.117 in 2019. In contrast\, had the higher education policies remained at their 1980 levels\, the standard deviation would have risen by 73% more to 0.139 by 2019. Agglomeration effects played a significant role in this result: if they had been half as strong as estimated\, the standard deviation would have increased by 17% more (instead of 73%) in the counterfactual than in the baseline.

Whether land is “artificialized” for cities\, used for agriculture\, or covered with forests dramatically impacts the resulting emissions. The spatial organization of cities\, such as the density and size of housing or the commuting distance to work also have a large impact on emissions. We develop a quantitative spatial theory of land use where different sectors\, agriculture\, forestry and housing\, compete for land. Technological and demographic evolutions trigger structural change and shape land use\, commuting and residential choices. Emissions change as a result. We estimate the quantitative model using French spatial data since 1950 across sectors. The estimation delivers novel insights on the determinants of land use and emissions across space and time\, and allows to evaluate the effect of various land use policies on welfare\, productivity and the environment. </span></p><br><b><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://url.au.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/wh2tC2xZLrcV5g5X6fnfKf5rFde?domain%3Dauckland.zoom.us&amp\;sa=D&amp\;source=calendar&amp\;ust=1747180704241129&amp\;usg=AOvVaw0p2F3189GNkC0Bb7ZusOu6" target="_blank"><u><u><u>Zoom link</u></u></u></a></b><br><br><span>Meeting ID: </span>227 055 6760

DESCRIPTION:Title: "<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5067071" target="_blank">Bottom-Up Institutional Change and Growth in China</a>"<br><br><b>Abstract</b>:   This paper investigates the formation and dissemination of key reform policies and their relationship to economic growth in China. Utilizing a unique dataset on county-level major events\, we document variations in the relative importance of top-down directives from the central authority versus bottom-up initiatives by local political entrepreneurs across different reforms. Our findings indicate that bottom-up reforms tend to incur higher political risks\, are negatively correlated with local fiscal capacity\, and receive fewer central government inspections prior to the local reforms. Learning and suitability considerations play a crucial role in the spatial diffusion of reforms\, particularly those originating from the bottom up. We observe that the innovations and diffusion of reform policies are positively correlated with GDP growth. Furthermore\, the sources of growth vary across different types of reforms: bottom-up policy changes are linked to positive Total Factor Productivity growth\, while centrally sponsored local policy experiments are associated with higher rates of fixed-capital investment. Consistent results are obtained when exploring alternative outcome measures of economic development\, including structural transformation from the agricultural to the non-agricultural sector and the entry of private firms.

DESCRIPTION:<b>Title</b>: Data Externalities\, Market Power\, and the Optimal Design of Central Bank Digital Currencies<br><br><b>Authors</b>: Yuteng Cheng\, Jonathan Chiu\, Mohammad Davoodalhosseini\, Janet Jiang<br><br><b>Abstract</b>: We develop a general equilibrium monetary model to analyze the role and impact of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in an economy with frictions such as market power of payment platforms\, the externalities of payment data and liquidity constraints. The data policy of the CBDC is an important aspect of public payment policy. We find that in general it is optimal to collect some payments data from CBDC transactions. Relative to the case where cash serves as the payment instrument issued by the central bank\, a data-collecting CBDC can even decrease the total amount of data collected in the economy. Issuing a CBDC could lead to a higher market share of the existing private payment platform.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Getting Along or Getting Ahead? The Domestic Roots of Status-Seeking in International Relations (with Kathryn Baragwanath)\n\nAbstract: This paper examines how domestic economic conditions shape international relations. We develop a novel measure of inter-government interactions using high-frequency event data across 18\,330 country dyads from 2001-2019. To establish causality\, we exploit plausibly exogenous variation in countries’ natural resource wealth driven by global commodity price shocks. We find that positive resource shocks significantly increase countries’ aggressive behavior in international relations\, primarily through verbal rather than material confrontation. This effect operates strategically: aggression is targeted at peripheral nations while avoiding major trading partners\, suggesting a deliberate approach to status enhancement that preserves economic relationships. The mechanism works through domestic political channels\, with resource windfalls reducing public discontent and providing governments with political capital to pursue more assertive foreign policy. Consistent with theories of status-seeking behavior as a tool for enhancing international standing\, the effects are concentrated in middle and low-income countries and in political systems with electoral accountability. Our findings highlight how domestic economic conditions influence international relations through the strategic pursuit of status\, with implications for understanding the economic roots of geopolitical behavior.\n\n----( Video Call )----\n[signup link removed]

DESCRIPTION:Title:  “The impact of interest: Firms' investment sensitivity to interest rates” (joint work with Lea Best and Manuel Menkhoff)<br><p>Abstract:<u> </u>We use a novel survey approach with hypothetical vignettes to analyze firms' investment sensitivity to interest rates\, allowing us to causally identify firms' investment adjustments in response to various changes in lending rates. In a large survey of German firms\, we find a semi-elasticity of investment of 7 percent—about half the total impact of monetary policy on corporate investment. The average response is driven by a substantial fraction of non-adjusters—mainly due to high cash buffers and a lack of investment opportunities—and a significant intensive margin conditional on adjustment. Using direct survey measures\, we find particularly strong effects for financially constrained firms and firms facing labor shortages. Finally\, we establish a first-order importance of the (partial equilibrium) interest rate channel effect for aggregate investment dynamics.</p>

DESCRIPTION:Title  "Frictional Capital Markets and Economic Growth".<p><b>Abstract</b>:   This paper develops an endogenous growth model where firms face idiosyncratic productivity shocks\, necessitating capital reallocation. Capital goods trade in a frictional dealer market\, giving rise to a distribution of capital holdings and Tobin's q across firms. The model highlights the intricate relationship between capital misallocation and growth. Absent externalities\, market frictions worsen capital misallocation and hinder growth. When brokers are perfect monopolists\, vanishing search frictions eliminate capital misallocation but leave growth ine¢ ciently low. With learning-by-doing externalities\, reducing frictions lowers misallocation but has nonmonotonic effects on growth and welfare. With entry\, higher dealer's bargaining power can reduce misallocation and growth.</p>

The issues arise from incomplete reporting\, leading to measurement error from false interpolation by the data provider\, the World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS)\, and selection bias from dropping tariffs when no trade is recorded. I develop a novel interpolation algorithm to correct these issues and construct a global tariff dataset. Reestimating recent studies relying on WITS data highlights the importance of correcting these errors.

LOCATION:H4.87\, Caulfield
DESCRIPTION:<b>Title</b>: "Social Norms and Transfer Progressivity in the Village".<p><b>Abstract</b>:   Using primary data on food transfers from an entire village in rural Malawi\, we document a high degree of transfer progressivity across households\, with an income-to-transfer elasticity of 0.60. Calibrating an endogenously incomplete market model with limited commitment and hidden effort to the village data yields constrained-efficient levels of transfer progressivity below those observed. To investigate this excess progressivity\, we introduce wedges into the LC constraints\, which we interpret as reflecting social norms—such as shunning or stigma—that amplify commitment. Counterfactual simulations show that removing these norms would increase village output by 38.5% and welfare by 5.27%. Finally\, these wedges largely vanish when we reduce current village income to historical productivity levels\, corresponding to the pre-fertilizer era\, suggesting that today’s excess progressivity reflects norms that have not yet adapted to improved economic conditions.</p>

We exploit state-level variation in right-to-work (RTW) laws as a proxy for union strength across local labor markets\, but show robustness to alternative measures of union activity. We find that labor markets in RTW states experienced relatively lower manufacturing employment growth as a result of NAFTA exposure than similarly exposed locations in non-RTW states. We also find a relative decline in manufacturing wage growth in locations with greater union presence\, suggesting that unions may have made wage concessions in exchange for increased job security.  Consistent with this\, we show that locations in which employment was concentrated in industries with stronger job security provisions prior to NAFTA experienced relatively smaller declines in manufacturing employment growth.<br><br><b>Zoom</b> <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://monash.zoom.us/j/84505903360?pwd%3DTXkBuX0aFh0beWxp0HNcQasgaZMRDg.1%26jst%3D2&amp\;sa=D&amp\;source=calendar&amp\;ust=1756166969692429&amp\;usg=AOvVaw1XCEFWEch16Qks_ih-7D2k" target="_blank">link</a> or<br>Meeting ID: 845 0590 3360 Passcode: 143090

Using a newly constructed microlevel dataset that links transaction-level U.S. import data from Bills of Lading with high-frequency consumer prices and sales from a consumer panel\, we develop a novel approach to estimate the price effects of cost shocks and product availability. Motivated by a model of delivery delays\, cost shocks\, and firm pricing\, we implement a shift-share identification strategy based on delivery shortfalls\, port congestion\, and freight and import costs. We find sizable pass-through elasticities: firms raise prices in response to higher import costs and delivery delays\, especially when disruptions persist. We also identify strategic pricing: firms—including non-importers—increase prices in response to competitors’ supply chain disruptions. Using our estimates and back-of-the-envelope calculations from the model\, we show that strategic interactions significantly amplified the direct effects of supply chain shocks on consumer prices during the pandemic.

DESCRIPTION:<b>Title</b>: "The Long-term Decline of the U.S. Job Ladder."<div dir="auto"><div dir="auto"><b>Abstract</b>:  We quantify the contribution of changes to the structure of the U.S. labor market to wage stagnation over the past 40 years. Using a rich structural model of wage and employment dynamics estimated on Current Population Survey data\, we reach three main conclusions. First\, upward job mobility has fallen by roughly half between the 1980s and 2010s. Second\, little of this decrease is accounted for by weaker aggregate labor demand. Instead\, we identify three key structural forces behind the decline of the U.S. job ladder: increased mismatch between job openings and job seekers\, rising employer concentration that limits job shopping opportunities\, and reduced job search among the employed. Third\, by curbing upward mobility\, these structural shifts have lowered aggregate real wage growth by four percentage points since the 1980s\, corresponding to approximately 40 percent of the decline of the aggregate labor share.

We propose a methodology based on a comprehensive understanding of Buy American regulations to identify government spending that is more and less constrained by domestic content restrictions. We validate our methodology in a novel firm-level dataset\, and then apply it to federal spending at the state level. We show that government dollars that are not constrained by domestic content restrictions have a higher cross-sectional fiscal multiplier than constrained contract dollars. We rationalize our findings in the context of a New Keynesian model of U.S. regions. Though Buy-American restrictions reduce direct leakage of government dollars abroad\, they cause government spending shocks to behave like negative labor supply shocks to the private sector\, dampening the GDP response.<br><br><b>Zoom</b> <a href="[signup link removed]" target="_blank"><u>link</u></a> or<br>Meeting ID: 891 0583 4317 Passcode: 883949

DESCRIPTION:<p><strong>Title:</strong> <em>“The International RBC Model Finally Works!”</em> (joint work with Edouard Challe and Louphou Coulibaly)</p><br><br><b>Abstract: </b>We show that incorporating market incompleteness and countercyclical income risk can reconcile the predictions of an otherwise standard international real business cycle model (IRBC) with data. In particular\, we analytically show that accounting for countercyclical risk can account for the low and negative correlation between relative consumption across countries and the real exchange rate (Backus-Smith puzzle)\, and the fact that consumption across countries is less correlated than output (Backus-Kehoe-Kydland puzzle). Our model can also explain the difference between the business cycles in emerging versus developed economies such as a stronger countercyclicality of trade balances in emerging markets\, and consumption volatility that exceeds output volatility.

DESCRIPTION:Title: "Choosing When to Work: The Productivity Effects of Flexible Scheduling"\n\nAbstract: Do flexible work-hour arrangements enhance or hinder productivity? To examine this question\, we conducted an experiment on a major online freelancing platform. We posted three otherwise identical data-entry job advertisements that varied only in the level of flexibility in choosing work hours. For each job\, we invited a random group of freelancers to apply and hired all who accepted our invitation. Among those initially hired under no- or limited-flexibility contracts\, a randomly selected subset was later granted full flexibility. Our results show that freelancers hired under rigid schedules produced 35% fewer correct entries compared to those with flexible hours. About 40% of this gap is due to selection - more productive workers are more likely to opt for flexible jobs. The remaining 60% reflects the direct impact of (in)flexibility itself.

DESCRIPTION:Title: "Born Again: Experimental Evidence on the Economic and Social Impacts of Religious Renewal\," co-authored with Francesco Loiacono and Jakob Svensson\n\nAbstract: Pentecostal and Evangelical Christianity is among the world’s fastest-growing movements\, with more than 600 million adherents and much of its expansion concentrated in the Global South. This paper provides experimental evidence on the economic and social effects of religious renewal. Partnering with a Pentecostal-Evangelical church in Uganda\, we study a common outreach activity designed to encourage new membership. Our experimental design identifies who joins when encouraged and estimates the causal effects of joining. Consistent with a club-good view of religious participation\, those induced to join become more religiously engaged and experience substantial gains in social networks and earnings. The effects vary by gender\, suggesting distinct pathways through which religious renewal can shape economic and social life.

DESCRIPTION:<br><b>"The Importance of Consumer Taste in Belgian Food Exports"</b><br>B. Aw (Penn State)\, Y. Lee (National University Taiwan) and H. Vandenbussche (KU Leuven)<br><br><i>This paper empirically estimates the relative importance of consumer taste\, product quality and production efficiency in explaining firms' </i><i>export success in a wide range of Belgian food products. We estimate export sales as a function of price and two unobservable variables\, local taste and product quality. A control function approach is used with exogenous instruments for the unobservable variables. From these </i><i>export demand estimations\, we obtain the price elasticity which is then used to back out from the export price\, the marginal cost of production. With an estimate of local taste\, product quality and marginal cost for every export now in every period in hand\, we then perform a </i><i>decomposition of annual firm-level export revenues to determine the relative importance of taste\, quality and cost in export success. Local </i><i>consumer taste is found\, on average\, to explain about 15%\, product quality about 25% and marginal cost of production about 15% of export </i><i>revenue variation in a wide variety of food products. Thus\, our finding that consumer taste in food products is just as important in magnitude </i><i>as production costs in explaining firm export success is information that can enable firms to more effectively manage their limited resources and succeed in an increasingly competitive international market.</i>

DESCRIPTION:Title: "Divisive by Design: Shaping Values Optimal Mechanisms"\n\nAbstract: "We study a principal who allocates a good to agents with private\, independently distributed values through an optimal mechanism. The principal can strategically shape these value distributions by modifying the good's features\, which affect agents' valuations. Our analysis reveals that optimal designs are frequently divisive– creating goods that appeal strongly to specific agents or agent types while being less valued by others. These divisive designs reduce information rents and increase total surplus\, at the expense of competition. Even when total surplus is constrained\, some divisiveness in designs remains optimal."

DESCRIPTION:Title: "Moral Regulation and Cultural Production: Evidence from Hollywood" with Ruixue Jia\n\nAbstract: "Moral regulation is widespread across societies\, yet its consequences have seldom been examined empirically. We study the Hays Code (July 1934–1960s)\, which imposed systematic moral guidelines on American cinema. Using a regression-discontinuity design comparing U.S. and non-U.S. films druing 1925–1955\, we find that moral compliance rose sharply after 1935 and remained high for decades. The Code also reshaped protagonists and political tone: protagonists became less likely to be women or working class\, and political tones grew more conservative. Filmmakers adapted both by increasing compliance within genres and by shifting across them: less-compliant Drama declined while more-compliant Western and Action rose. Companies with a larger market size and immigrant film directors exhibited stronger responses. These findings reveal that well-intentioned moral regulation can produce broad and often unintended spillovers. We also highlight a methodological concern we term AI-Self-Confirmatory Bias\, in which a large language model may affirm a researcher’s hypothesis because it already “believes” it to be true."\n\n----( Video Call )----\n[signup link removed]

DESCRIPTION:Title: "How Political Institutions Shape Education Spending: Supermajority Requirements in U.S. School Investments" (joint with Barbara Biasi and Julien Lafortune)\n\nAbstract: This paper examines how political institutions shape the size and composition of educational spending in the United States. We study the case of school capital investments\, which are funded by bonds issued by school districts. These bonds are subject to approval in local referenda for which eleven states require a supermajority of voters. To study the equilibrium impacts of super- majority requirements on the size and composition of school capital investments\, we build and estimate a structural model of bond proposal\, design\, and voting. In the model\, school districts consider when to propose a bond\, design the size and composition of capital investments\, and submit them to voters for approval in local elections. Using a newly assembled dataset of more than 7\,000 bond referenda\, we estimate heterogeneous preferences of school districts and voters across eight U.S. states. With these estimates\, we then examine the impact of changes in majority requirements. We find that voter and district preferences differ substantially from each other. Policy simulations show that an increase in the required supermajority leads districts to push for projects that are smaller and more aligned with voter preferences\, with important implications for student outcomes.\n\n----( Video Call )----\n[signup link removed]

DESCRIPTION:Title: The Logic and Consequences of Equalizing Bureaucratic Recruitment: Evidence from the 1073 Examination Reform in Song China\n\nAbstract:\nWe study how equalizing opportunities for bureaucratic recruitment reshapes politics in distinct stages. Initially\, it brings more officials from humble backgrounds into the bureaucracy. Their lack of patronage ties\, however\, limits prospects for career advancement and thus motivates them to seek promotion by displaying exceptional loyalty and zeal in carrying out the ruler’s preferred policies—often with downstream effects on governance and social stability. We test this argument using a reform of the civil service examinations in Song China (960–1279)\, which shifted from literary composition to formulaic interpretation of the Confucian classics\, a change that favored candidates from modest backgrounds. The reform increased the presence of non-elite bureaucrats whose hometowns had greater access to printed books. Such officials then extracted more revenue as governors\, were increasingly assigned to positions designated for implementing the ruler’s agenda\, pursued the ruler’s preferred policy with greater intensity\, and faced higher rates of rebellion.
