SUMMARY:Anthony Goldbloom (Kaggle) "Data prediction competitions: far more than just a bit of fun"
LOCATION:Monash University\, Clayton Campus\, VIC 3800\, Australia\, Menzies Building\, Room E269
DESCRIPTION:Abstract:<br />\nKaggle is a global platform for data prediction competitions allowing researchers and companies to post their problem and have it scrutinised by the world's statisticians and computer scientists. <br />\n\nBy exposing a problem to a wide range of analysts and techniques\, data prediction competitions turn out to be great way to get the most out of a dataset\, given its inherent noise and richness. For example\, Kaggle has been running a bioinformatics competition requiring participants to pick markers in HIV's genetic sequence that predict a change in viral load (a measure of the severity of infection). Within a week and a half\, the best submission had already outdone the best methods in the scientific literature. <br /><br />\n\nBio:\nBefore founding Kaggle in 2009\, Anthony worked in the macroeconomic modelling areas of the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Australian Treasury. During an internship at The Economist magazine in 2008\, Anthony wrote an article about the use of data-driven decision making by companies. He became so fascinated by the power of data that he left his day-job as an econometrician to found Kaggle.

SUMMARY:Daniel Smith (Simon Fraser and QUT)  "Conditional Backtesting of Value-at-Risk Models"
LOCATION:Monash University\, Clayton Campus\, VIC 3800\, Australia\, Menzies Building\, Room E269
DESCRIPTION:Abstract:  <br>\nWe study the ability of conditional and unconditional backtests to detect misspecification of Value-at-Risk (VaR) models. We include the most common conditional and unconditional tests\, a quantile regression-based test\, and some conditional Lagrange multiplier test based on a Probit model that are designed to detect exception cluster- ing. We demonstrate how backtesting can be used as a economically-motivate model specification tool for multivariate volatility models\, and derive conditions under which the asymptotic distribution of the test statistics are unaffected by the use of consis- tent estimates in place of the true parameter values. We undertake a Monte Carlo experiment to study the finite sample behavior of a range of conditional backtesting procedures and find that the unconditional coverage test\, which is the only test cur- rently used by banking regulators\, cannot reject historical simulation-based VaR when it is misspecified. We find that the conditional tests and the quantile regression-based test in particular\, do have power when there is a relatively long dataset. In an empirical study of actual bank VaR models we find that all five bank’s VaR models are misspec- ified and that much of the deficiency is due to their inability to adjust to changes in volatility. <br>\n\n<a href="http://www.sfu.ca/~drsmith/">Daniel Smith's webpage</a>

SUMMARY:Max King\, Gael Martin (Monash) - NOTE DIFFERENT TIME <br /> CLICK HERE FOR TITLES AND ABSTRACTS
LOCATION:Monash University\, Clayton Campus\, VIC 3800\, Australia\, Menzies Building\, Room E269
DESCRIPTION:Two 30-minute talks.<br />\n\n<a href="http://www.monash.edu.au/about/king.html">Max King</a>: A New Procedure for Multiple Testing of Econometric Models.<br />\nAbstract: A significant role for hypothesis testing in econometrics involves diagnostic checking. When checking the adequacy of a chosen\nmodel\, researchers almost always employ a range of diagnostic tests\, each of which is designed to detect a particular form of model inadequacy. A major problem is how best to control the overall probability of rejecting the model when it is true and multiple test statistics are used. This paper\npresents a new multiple testing procedure\, which involves checking whether the calculated values of the diagnostic statistics are consistent with the postulated model being true. This is done through a combination of bootstrapping to obtain a multivariate kernel density estimator of the\njoint density of the test statistics under the null hypothesis and the Monte Carlo simulations to obtain a p-value using this kernel density. The proposed testing procedure is applied to tests for serial correlation in an observed time series\, for normality\, and for model misspecification. We find that our testing procedure has correct or nearly correct sizes and good powers\, particular for more complicated testing problems. We believe it is the first good method for calculating the overall p-value for a vector of test statistics based on simulation.<br />\n<br />\n\n\n<a href="http://users.monash.edu.au/~gmartin/">Gael Martin</a>: Efficient Probabilistic Forecasts for Counts<br />\n\nAbstract: Efficient probabilistic forecasts of integer-valued random variables are derived. The optimality is achieved by estimating the forecast distribution nonparametrically over a given broad model class and proving asymptotic (nonparametric) efficiency in that setting. The method is developed within the context of the integer autoregressive class (INAR) of models\, which is a suitable class for any count data that can be interpreted as a queue\, stock\, birth and death process or branching process. The theoretical proofs of asymptotic efficiency are supplemented by simulation results that demonstrate the overall superiority of the nonparametric estimator relative to a misspecified parametric alternative\, in large but finite samples. The method is applied to counts of stock market iceberg orders. A subsampling method is used to assess sampling variation in the full estimated forecast distribution and a proof of its validity is given.

SUMMARY:Frank Vella (Georgetown) "Triangular semiparametric models featuring two dependent endogenous binary outcomes"
LOCATION:Monash University\, Clayton Campus\, VIC 3800\, Australia\, Menzies Building\, Room E457
DESCRIPTION:Title: Triangular semiparametric models featuring two dependent endogenous binary outcomes <br>\nAbstract: This paper addresses the estimation of a class of models which features two endogenous and dependent binary outcomes. This class includes the triangular model with a binary outcome and a binary treatment\, and several interesting variants on the sample selection model. The structure of the model imposes no distributional assumptions on the disturbances nor does it require that they enter additively. We formulate a quasi maximum likelihood estimator with semiparametric components that incorporate several bias adjustments. Under these adjustments\, we establish desirable large sample properties using regular kernels in place of higher order kernels. Simulation evidence conrms that this estimator performs well in nite samples.<br>\n\n<a href="http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/fgv/">Frank Vella's webpage</a>

SUMMARY:Valentyn Panchenko (UNSW): "Efficient estimation of parameters in marginals in semiparametric multivariate models"
LOCATION:Monash University\, Clayton Campus\, VIC 3800\, Australia\, Menzies Building\, Room E457
DESCRIPTION:Title: Efficient estimation of parameters in marginals in semiparametric multivariate models <br>\n<br>\n\nAbstract:<br>\nRecent literature on semiparametric copula models focused  on the situation when the marginals are specified nonparametrically and the copula function is given a parametric form. For example\, this setup is used in Chen\, Fan and Tsyrennikov (2006) [Efficient Estimation of Semiparametric Multivariate Copula Models\, JASA] who focus on efficient estimation of copula parameters.  We consider a reverse situation when the marginals are specified parametrically and the copula function is modelled nonparametrically. This setting is no less relevant in applications.<br>\n\nWe use the method of sieve for efficient estimation of parameters in marginals and show its asymptotic distribution.  Simulations show improvements in the efficiency of sieve MLE relative to QMLE depending on the strength of dependence between marginals.  An application using insurance company loss and expense data demonstrates empirical relevance of this setting.\n<br>\n\n<a href="http://www.economics.unsw.edu.au/ValentynPanchenko">Valentyn's webpage<a/>\n<br>

SUMMARY:Bob Breunig (ANU): "Is female labour supply in Australia not responsive to child care costs?"
LOCATION:Monash University\, Clayton Campus\, VIC 3800\, Australia\, Menzies Building\, Room E457
DESCRIPTION:Title: Is female labour supply in Australia not responsive to child care costs? <br>\n<br>\nAuthors: Xiaodong Gong and Robert Breunig<br>\n\nAffiliation: Australian National University<br>\n\n\nAbstract<br>\n\nPrevious studies (Doiron and Kalb (2005)\, Kalb and Lee (2008)\, Rammohan and Whelan(2005) and Rammohan and Whelan (2007)) have found that female labour supply in Australia is not responsive to the costs of child care.  The labour supply elasticity with respect to child care costs has been found to be very small and usually statistically insignificant.<br>\n\n\nWe show that these papers\, and many papers in the international literature\, suffer from a measurement error problem arising from the way in which child care prices are measured.  Furthermore\, and exacerbating the measurement error problem\, the standard model assumes that child care for different age children is a homogenously-priced good.<br>\n\n\nWe address these problems by extending the standard\, structural labour supply and child care model to allow for separate effects of the price of child care for children of different age ranges.  We estimate women's labour supply and child care demand simultaneously.  To overcome measurement error issues\, we use the median child care price at the local Labour Force Survey Region level constructed from child-specific prices for the analysis. The salient finding\, in contrast with previous Australian studies\, is that child care prices have significant effects both on mothers’ labour supply and child care demand. Based upon the latest three waves of HILDA data (2005-2007)\, the point estimate for the elasticity of mothers’ labour force participation with respect to the average child care price is -0.29\, which is significantly larger in magnitude than that found in previous studies for Australia\, but which is well in accordance with international findings. The robustness of this finding is supported by repeating the analysis for the earlier three waves (2002-2004).<br>\n<br>\n\n<a href="http://econrsss.anu.edu.au/Staff/breunig/contact_bb.htm">Bob Breunig's webpage<a/>

SUMMARY:Chris Lloyd (Melbourne Business School) "Parametric Bootstrap P-values: Why they are good and how to compute them"
LOCATION:Monash University\, Clayton Campus\, VIC 3800\, Australia\, Menzies Building\, Room E457
DESCRIPTION:Title: "Parametric Bootstrap P-values: Why they are good and how to compute them" <br>\nAbstract: For standard discrete models\, bootstrap P-value perform extraordinarily well\, much better than asymptotics predict. I trace this to three specific mathematical properties of the bootstrap transformation. First\, it corrects boundary anomalies. Second\, it improves pivotality of the P-value. Third\, it correctly calibrates the P-value\, but apparently only when applied to likelihood based test statistics. <br>\n\nI then move on to how to compute bootstrap (and other more exotic P-values) using importance sampling. This involves sampling whole curves from the profile distribution of the P-value. The standard recommendation for choosing the biasing distribution fails\, at least for the case of logistic regression. I will identify why it fails and develop a better criterion which works extremely well in all examples considered.<br>\n\n<a href="http://www.mbs.edu/home/lloyd/homepage/"> Chris Lloyd's webpage<a/>

SUMMARY:Vasilis Sarafidis (Sydney) "IV Estimation of Panels with Factor Residuals"
LOCATION:Monash University\, Clayton Campus\, VIC 3800\, Australia\, Menzies Building\, Room E269
DESCRIPTION:Abstract: This paper considers panel data regression models with residuals generated by a multifactor error structure and regressors that are not necessarily strongly exogenous. In such cases\, the standard dynamic panel estimators fail to provide consistent estimates of the parameters. We propose a new estimation procedure\, based on instrumental variables\, which retains the traditional attractive features of method of moments estimators. The novelty of our approach is that we introduce new parameters to represent the unobserved covariances between the instruments and the factor component of the residual\; these parameters are typically estimable when Nis large. Some important estimation and identification issues are studied in detail. The finite-sample performance of our estimator is investigated using simulated data. The results show that proposed method produces reliable estimates of the parameters over various parameterizations.<br>\n<a href="http://sydney.edu.au/business/staff/vasiliss">Webpage of Dr Sarafidis</a>

SUMMARY:Laurent Pauwels (Sydney) "Forecast combination in discrete choice models"
LOCATION:Monash University\, Clayton Campus\, VIC 3800\, Australia\, Menzies Building\, Room E269
DESCRIPTION:Title: "Forecast combination in discrete choice models: predicting FOMC monetary policy decisions" <br>\n<br>\nAbstract: This paper provides a new methodology to combine forecasts based on several univariate discrete choice models. This is achieved primarily by combining one-step-ahead forecast of probabilities associated\nwith each univariate model. The paper applies well-established scoring techniques for qualitative response models in the context of forecast\ncombination. Log-scores and quadratic-scores are used both to evaluate the forecasting performance of each model and to combine the\nforecasted probabilities. This new methodology is applied to forecast\nthe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decisions in changing\nthe federal funds target rate. Several of the economic fundamentals\ninfluencing the FOMC decisions are nonstationary over time and are\nmodelled in a similar fashion to Hu and Phillips (2004\, JoE). The empirical results show that combining forecasted probabilities using scores\nmostly outperforms both equal weight combination and forecasts based\non multivariate models.\n<br><br>\n<a href="http://www.econ.usyd.edu.au/staff/laurentp">Laurent Pauwels webpage</a>

SUMMARY:Jia Chen (Adelaide) "Semiparametric Trending Panel Data Models with Cross-Sectional Dependence"
LOCATION:Caulfield Campus\, Building H\, Level 4 Seminar Room
DESCRIPTION:Abstract:<br>\n\nWe introduce a semiparametric fixed effects model to describe the  \nnonlinear trending phenomenon in panel data analysis and it allows  \nfor the cross-sectional dependence in both the regressors and the  \nresiduals. A profile likelihood approach based on the first-stage  \nlocal linear fitting is developed to estimate both the parameter  \nvector and the time trend function. As both the time-series length T  \nand the cross-sectional size N tend to infinity simultaneously\, the  \nresulting semiparametric estimator of the parameter vector is  \nasymptotically normal with a rate of convergence of root-NT.  \nMeanwhile\, an asymptotic distribution for a nonparametric estimate of  \nthe nonlinear time trend function is also established with a rate of  \nconvergence of root-NTh. Two simulated examples are provided to  \nillustrate the finite sample behaviour of the proposed estimation  \nmethod. In addition\, the proposed model and estimation method is  \napplied to the analysis of two sets of real data. <br>\n<a href="http://www.adelaide.edu.au/directory/jia.chen">Dr Chen's webpage</a>

SUMMARY:Eik Swee (Melbourne Uni) - "Together or Separate? Post-conflict Partition\, Ethnic Homogenization\, and <br>the Provision of Public Schooling"
LOCATION:Room E457\, fourth floor\, Menzies Building\, Clayton Campus
DESCRIPTION:Abstract: The partitioning of political jurisdictions is becoming an increasingly common component of agreements to end ethnic conflict. While partitions have proved to be effective in achieving immediate peace\, their effect on post-conflict recovery remains unclear. This paper studies the effects of the partition which ended the 1992-1995 Bosnian War on the post-war provision of public goods at the municipality-level. Comparing trends in the provision of public schooling across partitioned and unpartitioned municipalities during the 1986-2006 period\, I find that partitioned municipalities provide 58 percent more primary schools and 37 percent more teachers (per capita). I also find evidence which suggests that convergent preferences – operating via ethnic politics – for ethnically oriented schools may be an important driver of the results\, although I cannot rule out the possibility of mechanical explanations. In addition\, as the increase in public goods provision may be ethnically oriented\, only the ethnic majority profits from this arrangement. These findings imply that partitions generate ethnic inequality that may undermine the sustainability of peace in the long run.<br>\n<a href="http://www.economics.unimelb.edu.au/who/profile.cfm?sid=794"> Dr Swee's webpage</a>

SUMMARY:Giuseppe Cavaliere (University of Bologna\, Italy) "Bootstrap Sequential Determination of the Co-integration Rank in VAR Models"
LOCATION:Room E457\, fourth floor\, Menzies Building\, Clayton Campus
DESCRIPTION:Determining the co-integrating rank of a system of variables has become a fundamental aspect of applied research in macroeconomics and finance. It is wellknown that standard asymptotic likelihood ratio tests for co-integration rank of Johansen (1996) can be unreliable in small samples with empirical rejection frequencies often very much in excess of the nominal level. As a consequence\, bootstrap versions of these tests have been developed. To be useful\, however\, sequential procedures for determining the co-integrating rank based on these bootstrap tests need to be consistent\, in the sense that the probability of selecting a rank smaller than (equal to) the true co-integrating rank will converge to zero (one minus the marginal significance level)\, as the sample size diverges\, for general I(1) processes. No such likelihood-based procedure is currently known to be available. In this paper we fill this gap in the literature by proposing a bootstrap sequential algorithm which we demonstrate delivers consistent cointegration rank estimation for general I(1) processes. Finite sample Monte Carlo simulations show the proposed procedure performs well in practice.<br>\n<a href="http://www2.stat.unibo.it/cavaliere/">Professor Cavaliere's webpage</a>

SUMMARY:Sophia Dimelis (Athens University) "The Role of ICT in Reducing Inefficiencies: <br>A Stochastic Production Frontier Study across OECD Countries"
LOCATION:Room E457\, fourth floor\, Menzies Building\, Clayton Campus
DESCRIPTION:In this paper we explored the idea that technologies associated with information and communications may have a contribution in reducing productive inefficiencies. A stochastic production frontier is simultaneously estimated with a technical inefficiency model using a panel of 17 OECD countries in the period 1990-2005. Clear evidence is found for a significant ICT impact in the reduction of cross country inefficiencies. In particular\, the results show that\, on average\, ICT contributed by more than 5% in the increase of technical efficiency across countries and over time. The efficiency estimates indicate that the relatively more efficient countries are Belgium and Netherlands\, followed by the USA. Several south European countries are less efficient and have not yet converged to the efficiency levels of the most developed OECD countries.<br>\n<a href="http://www.aueb.gr/pages_en/didaktiko/faculty_en_short.php?facid=1219"> Professor Dimelis webpage</a>

SUMMARY:Robert Jung (Erfurt University\, Germany) "Useful Models for Time Series of Counts or Simply Wrong Ones?"
LOCATION:Room E457\, fourth floor\, Menzies Building\, Clayton Campus
DESCRIPTION:There has been a considerable and growing interest in low \ninteger-valued time series data leading to a diversification of \nmodelling approaches. In addition to static regression models\, both \nobservation-driven and parameter-driven models are considered here. We \ncompare and contrast a variety of time series models for counts using \ntwo very different data sets as a testbed.  A range of diagnostic \ndevices is employed to help inform model adequacy. Special attention \nis paid to dynamic structure and underlying distributional assumptions \nincluding associated dispersion properties. Competing models show \nattractive features\, but overall no one modelling approach is seen to \ndominate.<br>\n<a href="http://www.uni-erfurt.de/en/oekonometrie/team/prof-dr-robert-jung/">Professor Jung's webpage</a>

The result carries over to models for duration and realised volatility that use an exponential link function.

SUMMARY:Sandra Eickmeier (Deutsche Bundesbank\, Germany) "The Changing International Transmission of Financial Shocks: <br>Evidence from a Classical Time-Varying FAVAR"
LOCATION:Room E457\, fourth floor\, Menzies Building\, Clayton Campus
DESCRIPTION:We study the changing international transmission of US financial shocks over the\nperiod 1971-2009. Financial shocks are defined as unexpected changes of a newly\ndeveloped financial conditions index (FCI) for the US. We use a time-varying factor-\naugmented VAR (TV-FAVAR) to model the FCI jointly with a large set of macro-\neconomic\, financial and trade variables for nine major advanced countries. We find\nthat expansionary US financial shocks have a considerable positive impact on growth\nin the countries in our dataset\, and vice versa for negative shocks. The transmission\nto GDP growth in the euro-area countries and in Japan has increased gradually since\nthe 1980s\, consistent with globalization. A more marked increase is detected in the\nearly 1980s in the US itself and the UK\, consistent with structural changes in financial\nmarkets. The size of US financial shocks varies strongly over time\, with the 'global\nfinancial crisis shock' being larger than any other financial shock estimated over the\nsample under analysis and explaining 30-60 percent of the variation in GDP growth in\n2008-2009 (compared to a little more than 10 percent on average over the 1971-2007\nperiod). A large breakdown in exports contributed to the strong worldwide propagation of US financial shocks during the crisis. Differences in the real effects across\ncountries are related to differences in openness\, banks' capitalization\, the fiscal and\nmonetary policy stance\, and overheating of the economy prior to the crisis.<br>\n<a href="http://www.bundesbank.de/vfz/vfz_mitarbeiter_eickmeier.php">Dr Eickmeier's webpage</a>

LOCATION:Room E363 - Menzies Building - Clayton Campus
DESCRIPTION:Title: "Local Government Capability and Public Spending Efficacy:<br/>\nEvidence from a Decentralized Government Transfer Program in Indonesia"\n<br>\n Abstract: This paper investigates the association between pre-existing local government\ncapability and the size of grants from the central government that is actually delivered\nto intended beneficiaries by the local government. Combining administrative data and\nhousehold survey datasets\, we show that only 78 percent of the grants under the\nInpres Desa Tertinggal (IDT)–Indonesia’s poverty alleviation program–were received\nby intended beneficiaries. IDT’s decentralized distribution scheme suggests that this\nloss took place at the village level. Failing to taking this into account leads to\nmisleading conclusion about the program’s targeting performance. We find that preexisting\nadministrative and organizational skills of village governments are positively\nassociated with the share of funds reaching beneficiaries. The results of our panel\nanalysis further reveal that the capability of village government became particularly\nimportant over time. To the extent that these results reflect a causal relationship\, they\nimply that training of local government officials is likely to reduce the disappearance\nof public resources and improve public spending efficacy.\n<br>\n<a href="http://www3.grips.ac.jp/~yamauchi/">Dr Yamauchi's webpage</a>

LOCATION:Room E457\, Menzies Building\, Clayton Campus
DESCRIPTION:Title: "Volatility in Oil Prices and Manufacturing Activity: <br>\nAn Investigation of Real Options"\n<br>\nAbstract: Previous research shows that volatility in oil prices has tended to depress output\, as\nmeasured by non-residential investment and GDP. This is interpreted as evidence in support\nof the theory of real options in capital budgeting decisions\, which predicts that uncertainty\nabout\, for example\, commodity prices\, will cause firms to delay production and investment.\nWe continue that investigation by analyzing the e¤ect of oil price uncertainty on monthly\nmeasures of U.S. firm production related to industries in mining\, manufacturing and utilities.\nWe use a more general specification\, an updated sample that includes the increased oil price\nvolatility since 2008\, and we control for other nonlinear measures of oil prices. We find\nadditional empirical evidence in support of the predictions of real options theory\, and our\nresults indicate that the extreme volatility in oil prices observed in 2008 and 2009 contributed\nto the severity of the decline in manufacturing activity.\n<br>\n\n<a href="http://econ.ucalgary.ca/profiles/apostolos-serletis">Prof Serletis's webpage</a>

SUMMARY:Professor Wagner Kamakura (Duke University) - "A Factor-analytic Random-Coefficients Model to Uncover Audience Preferences for Concert Features from Ticket Sales"
LOCATION:Room E457 - Menzies Building - Clayton Campus
DESCRIPTION:Title: "A Factor-analytic Random-Coefficients Model to Uncover Audience Preferences for Concert Features from Ticket Sales"\n\nAbstract: To better plan their programs\, producers of performing arts events need forecasting models that relate ticket sales to the features of a program.  The framework we develop\, test and implement uncovers audience preferences for the features of an event program from ticket sales\, while accounting for interactions among program features and for preference heterogeneity across markets. We develop a factor-analytic random-coefficients model that overcomes three major methodological challenges.  First\, the historical data available from each market is limited\, preventing the estimation of statistical models at the market level\, and requiring some form of shrinkage estimator that also takes into account the diversity in preferences across markets. However\, preferences for the many (26 in our application) program features are likely correlated across markets\, requiring the estimation of a large covariance matrix for these preferences across markets.  We propose a factor-analytic regression formulation that parsimoniously captures the principal components of the correlated preferences and provides shrinkage estimates at the individual market level.\n\nThe second methodological challenge is that program features are likely to interact requiring the estimation of a large set of pair-wise interactions.  We solve this problem by mapping the interactions on a reduced space\, arriving at a more parsimonious model formulation.  The third methodological challenge relates to implementation of the model results beyond the relatively small sample of markets for which historical data was available. To overcome this limitation\, we demonstrate how our model can be applied to markets not included in our sample\, first using only managerial insight regarding the similarity between the focal market and the ones in our sample and by updating this subjective prior as ticket sales data become available.\n\n<a href="http://www.fuqua.duke.edu/faculty_research/faculty_directory/kamakura/">Professor Kamakura's webpage</a>

SUMMARY:Dr Eik Swee (Melbourne Uni) - "Together or Separate? Post-conflict Partition\, Ethnic Homogenization\, and the Provision of Public Schooling"
LOCATION:Room E457\, Menzies Building\, Clayton Campus
DESCRIPTION:Title:"Together or Separate? Post-conflict Partition\, Ethnic Homogenization\, and <br>the Provision of Public Schooling" \n<br>\nAbstract: The partitioning of political jurisdictions is becoming an increasingly common component of agreements to end ethnic conflict. While partitions have proved to be effective in achieving immediate peace\, their effect on post-conflict recovery remains unclear. This paper studies the effects of the partition which ended the 1992-1995 Bosnian War on the post-war provision of public goods at the municipality-level. Comparing trends in the provision of public schooling across partitioned and unpartitioned municipalities during the 1986-2006 period\, I find that partitioned municipalities provide 58 percent more primary schools and 37 percent more teachers (per capita). I also find evidence which suggests that convergent preferences – operating via ethnic politics – for ethnically oriented schools may be an important driver of the results\, although I cannot rule out the possibility of mechanical explanations. In addition\, as the increase in public goods provision may be ethnically oriented\, only the ethnic majority profits from this arrangement. These findings imply that partitions generate ethnic inequality that may undermine the sustainability of peace in the long run.<br>\n<a href="http://www.eikswee.com/">Dr Swee's webpage</a>

SUMMARY:Dr David Veredas (Université libre de Bruxelles) - "Modeling Vast Panels of Volatilities with Long-Memory Dynamic Factor Models"
LOCATION:Seminar Room\, Level 4\, Building H\, Caulfield Campus
DESCRIPTION:Title: Modeling Vast Panels of Volatilities with Long-Memory Dynamic Factor Models (joint with Matteo Luciani)<br>\n\nAbstract<br>\nModeling vast panels of volatilities has always been an issue of paramount importance\, yet elusive. These volatilities\, when observed through time\, share certain stylized facts:\nco-movement\, clustering and long-memory. Based on Dynamic Factor Models\, we propose a methodology that i) disentangles between commonness and idiosyncrasies\, ii) is suitable for large dimensions\, and iii) explains the above-mentioned stylized facts. A throughout Monte Carlo study shows the usefulness of the approach both in terms of factor identification and parameter estimation. An application to 90 daily realized volatilities\, pertaining to S&P100\, from January 2001 to December 2008\, evinces five findings. i) All the volatilities have long memory\, more than half of them in the nonstationary range\, which increases during financial turmoil. ii) Tests and criteria point towards one dynamic common factor driving the co-movements\, which naturally qualifies as the unobservable market volatility. iii) This factor has larger long memory that the assets volatilities\, suggesting that\nlong-memory is a market characteristic. Indeed\, the idiosyncratic components show a much smaller deal of fractional integration. iv) The time-varying long-memory is mainly due to the common factor\, while the degree of long-memory in the idiosyncrasies is relatively stable. v) a forecasting horse race with univariate models shows the factor models overwhelming win for short-\, medium- and long-run predictions.

LOCATION:Seminar Room\, Building H\, Caulfield Campus
DESCRIPTION:Title: Mistargeting of Cash Transfers\, Social Capital Destruction and Crime in Indonesia\n\nAbstract: Cash transfer programs can be a useful tool for providing support for poor households in developing countries. The potential for substantial mistargeting is however high. This paper focuses on the potential social consequences arising from misallocation of resources in close knit communities. We find that the mistargeting of a cash transfer program in Indonesia is significantly associated with increases in crime and declines in social capital within communities. Hence there exists a potentially large negative downside associated with poor targeting performance that extends beyond the pure financial costs that have been the focus of the literature to date.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Modelling Electricity Power Cuts in the UK\n\nAbstract: We consider a compound Poisson model for electricity power cuts. Cuts occur at rate $\\lambda$ and we associate with the $i$-th cut a duration $L_i$ and size $C_i$\, where $L_i$ and $C_i$ are heavy tailed and positively correlated. Development of the model is complicated by the fact that we have no direct observations of $(L_i\, C_i)$. Rather\, if $N$ is the number of power cuts in a year\, we have observations of $\\sum_{i=1}^N C_iL_i$ and $\\sum_{i=1}^N C_i$. This necessitates the use of a parsimonious model for $(L_i\, C_i)$\, and we have based ours on the Pareto distribution. To fit the model we apply kernel density estimation to simulated data to obtain estimates of the likelihood\, which we then maximise using stochastic optimisation.

LOCATION:Room E457 - Menzies Building - Clayton Campus
DESCRIPTION:Title: "GMM Estimation of Parameters of Generalised Beta Distribution using Limited/Aggregate Data\n With applications to the Measurement of Regional and Global Inequality."\n\nIn this paper we develop a GMM procedure for estimating a generalized beta class of income distributions (GB2\, beta-2\, Singh-Maddala and Dagum) when we have grouped data with unknown group bounds. The approach enables us to obtain standard errors for the estimated parameters and any functions of the parameters (for example\, inequality and poverty measures) and to test the validity of the assumed distribution using J-test statistics. The results shows that GB2 fits data very well and outperforms other frequently used distributions including beta-2\, Singh-Maddala\, and Dagum distributions. The paper also presents results on levels and trends in regional and global inequality over the period 1993 to 2005.\n\n<a href="http://www.uq.edu.au/economics/rao-prasada">Professor Rao's web page.</a>

DESCRIPTION:Title: Spot the volatilty: the break preserving local linear estimator\n\nAbstract:\nThe objective of this paper is to introduce the break preserving local linear (BPLL) estimator for the estimation of unstable volatility functions for independent and asymptotically independent processes. Breaks in the structure of the conditional mean and/or the volatility functions are common in Finance. Nonparametric estimators are well suited these events due to the flexibility of their functional form and their good asymptotic properties. However\, the local polynomial kernel estimators are not consistent at points where the volatility function has a break. The estimator presented in this paper generalises the classical local linear (LL). The BPLL maintains the desirable properties of the LL with regard to the bias and the boundary estimation while it estimates the breaks consistently. An extensive Monte Carlo study is shown as well as detailed proofs of the estimator asymptotic behaviour.\n\n<a href="http://ideas.repec.org/f/pca472.html">Dr Casas at IDEAS</a>

SUMMARY:Dr Prasad Bhattacharya (Deakin University) - "Improving Forecasting Performance by Window and Model Averaging"
LOCATION:Room E457\, Menzies Building\, Clayton Campus
DESCRIPTION:Title: Improving Forecasting Performance by Window and Model Averaging\n \nAbstract\n \nThis study presents new and extensive results on the benefits of rolling window and model averaging. Extending the recent work on window and model averaging\, we find strong evidence that rolling window averaging improves the forecasting performance of both individual models and model averaging. The rolling window averaging outperforms ‘optimal’ window forecasts in more than 50% of the times across all rolling windows. In addition\, the averaging smoothes out the forecast path\, improves robustness\, and minimizes problems of potential structural breaks in the forecasting period.

SUMMARY:Professor Eric Leeper (Indiana and Monash) "Foresight and Information Flows" - joint seminar with the Economics Department
LOCATION:Building 60\, Room E6\, Clayton Campus
DESCRIPTION:Abstract. News—or foresight—about future economic fundamentals can create rational\nexpectations equilibria with non-fundamental representations that pose substantial challenges\nto econometric efforts to recover the structural shocks to which economic agents react. Using\ntax policies as a leading example of foresight\, simple theory makes transparent the economic\nbehavior and information structures that generate non-fundamental equilibria. Econometric\nanalyses that fail to model foresight will obtain biased estimates of output multipliers for\ntaxes\; biases are quantitatively important when two canonical theoretical models are taken\nas data generating processes. Both the nature of equilibria and the inferences about the\neffects of anticipated tax changes hinge critically on hypothesized tax information flows.\nDifferential U.S. federal tax treatment of municipal and treasury bonds embeds news about\nfuture taxes in bond yield spreads. Including that measure of tax news in identified VARs\nproduces substantially different inferences about the macroeconomic impacts of anticipated\ntaxes.\n\n<a href="http://mypage.iu.edu/~eleeper/">Professor Leeper's Home Page.</a>

SUMMARY:Dr Guohua Feng (Monash University) - "Undesirable Outputs and a Primal Divisia Productivity Growth Index Based on the Directional Output Distance Function"
LOCATION:Seminar Room\, Building H\, Caulfield Campus
DESCRIPTION:Title: "Undesirable Outputs and a Primal Divisia Productivity Growth Index Based on the Directional Output Distance Function"\n\nAbstract: We first derive a primal productivity growth index\, which is valid in the presence of\nundesirable outputs\, by total differentiation of the directional output distance function with\nrespect to a time trend. We refer to this index as the Divisia-Luenberger productivity index.\nWe show that this index nests the Feng and Serletis (2010) output-distance-function-based\nprimal Divisia productivity index as a special case\, and that it is also an approximation to\nthe Malmquist-Luenberger productivity index\, proposed by Chung et al. (1997). We then\nassess the bias in the conventional productivity growth indexes. In doing so\, we use the\nFeng and Serletis (2010) index as a representative of the conventional Divisia productivity\nindexes as it is dual to all the famous Divisia-type productivity/technical change indexes\nin the literature. We also decompose the bias into two components with one attributed\nto the growth in undesirable outputs and the other to bias in desirable output and input\nweights. Finally\, we investigate productivity growth in 15 OECD countries and find that the\nproductivity growth bias ranges from 5:18% to 35:70%. Moreover\, the bias in productivity\ngrowth changes the ranking of individual countries in terms of productivity growth.\n\n<a href="http://www.buseco.monash.edu.au/about/staff/profile.php?cn=guohua-feng">Dr Feng's webpage.</a>

SUMMARY:Professor Frank Vella "Semiparametric Selection Models with Binary Outcomes\," joint seminar with the Economics Department
LOCATION:Building 60\, Room E6\, Clayton Campus
DESCRIPTION:Title: Semiparametric Selection Models with Binary Outcomes\n\nAbstract\nThis paper addresses the estimation of a semiparametric sample\nselection index model where both the selection rule and the outcome\nvariable are binary. Since the marginal effects are often of primary\ninterest and are difficult to recover in a semiparametric setting\, we\ndevelop estimators for both the marginal effects and the underlying\nmodel parameters. The marginal effect estimator only uses observations\nwhich are members of a high probability set in which the selection\nproblem is not present. A key innovation is that this high probability\nset is data dependent. The model parameter estimator is a\nquasi-likelihood estimator based on regular kernels with bias\ncorrections. We establish their large sample properties and provide\nsimulation evidence confirming that these estimators perform well in\nfinite samples.\n\n<a href="http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/fgv/">Professor Vella's Home Page.</a>

LOCATION:Room E457\, Menzies Building\, Clayton Campus
DESCRIPTION:Title: The Impact of Fertility on Mothers’ Labour Supply in Australia: Evidence from Exogenous Variation in Family Size\n\nAbstract: This paper estimates the impact of fertility on mothers’ labour supply in Australia\, using exogenous variation in family size generated by twin births and the gender mix of siblings. Results show that having more than one child decreases labour market participation by 15.5 percentage points and hours worked by around 6 hours per week. Having more than two children reduces labour market participation by between 12 and 20 percentage points and hours worked by between 3 and 8 hours a week\, depending on the instrument used. Interestingly\, fathers also reduce both their labour market participation (by 10 percentage points) and their number of hours worked per week (by 4 hours) when having more than one child. Compared with the results obtained with the same methodology for other countries\, the effects for Australia are large\, which partly reflects the constraints on public childcare and the lack of a national paid parental leave scheme prior to 2011.\n\n<a href="http://www.melbourneinstitute.com/staff/julie-moschion/default.html">Dr Moschion's webpage</a>.

LOCATION:Room E457\, Menzies Building\, Clayton Campus
DESCRIPTION:Title: Volatility timing and portfolio selection: How best to forecast volatility\n\nAbstract: Within the context of volatility timing and portfolio selection this paper considers how best to estimate a volatility model. Two issues are dealt with\, namely the frequency of data used to construct volatility estimates\, and the loss function used to estimate the parameters of a volatility model. We find support for the use of intraday data for estimating volatility which is consistent with earlier research. We also find that the choice of loss function is important and show that a simple mean squared error loss\, overall provides the best forecasts of volatility upon which to form optimal portfolios.\n\n<a href="http://staff.qut.edu.au/staff/clementa/">Professor Clements's web page</a>

SUMMARY:Professor James Morley (UNSW) - Likelihood-Based Confidence Sets for the Timing of Structural Breaks
LOCATION:Room E457\, Menzies Building\, Clayton Campus
DESCRIPTION:Title: Likelihood-Based Confidence Sets for the Timing of Structural Breaks\n\nWe propose a new approach to constructing confidence sets for the timing of structural breaks. The confidence sets are based on marginal “fiducial” distributions of break dates\, which are simulated from the likelihood function via Markov-chain Monte Carlo methods. We show that the confidence sets can be related to a sequence of average exponential likelihood ratio tests and are\, therefore\, admissible. Using Monte Carlo analysis\, we compare the finite-sample performance of our proposed approach to standard asymptotic and bootstrap confidence sets for break dates given structural breaks of the kind hypothesized for macroeconomic data. The confidence sets based on marginal fiducial distributions perform best overall in terms of short length and accurate coverage. For our application\, we investigate the nature and timing of structural breaks in postwar U.S. Real GDP. Based on our proposed approach\, we find much tighter 95% confidence sets for the timing of the so-called “Great Moderation” than have been previously reported.\n\n\n<a href="http://www.asb.unsw.edu.au/schools/Pages/JamesMorley.aspx">Professor Morley's web page</a>

LOCATION:Lecture Theater H2\, Menzies Building\, Clayton Campus
DESCRIPTION:Title: A POWERFUL ENTROPY TEST FOR “LINEARITY” AGAINST NONLINEARITY IN TIME SERIES\n\nAbstract. In this paper we investigate a test for the identification of nonlin-\near dependence in time series against more general “nulls” than mere “inde-\npendence”. The approach is based on a combination of an entropy dependence\nmetric\, possessing many desirable properties and used as a test statistic\, to-\ngether with a suitable extension of surrogate data methods\, a class of Monte\nCarlo based tests introduced with the aim of building consistent distribution-\nfree tests for nonlinearity. The use of bootstrap methods is also investigated.\nIn this paper we show how the test can be employed in order to detect the lags\nat which a significant nonlinear relationship is expected in the same fashion\nas the autocorrelation function is used for linear processes. We discuss some\ntheoretical aspects related to the entropy measure and its estimators. The\npower and size of the test is assessed through simulation studies\; applications\nto well known real data are also presented.\n\n<a href="http://userwww.service.emory.edu/~mboerck/">Professor Maasoumi's web page.</a>

SUMMARY:Professor Tommaso Proietti (Sydney) - The Variance Profile
LOCATION:Room E457\, Menzies Building\, Clayton Campus
DESCRIPTION:Title: The Variance Profile\n\nAbstract: The variance profile is defined as the power mean of the spectral density function of a\nstationary stochastic process. It is a continuous and non-decreasing function of the power\nparameter\, p\, which returns the minimum of the spectrum (p → −∞)\, the interpolation error\nvariance (harmonic mean\, p = −1)\, the prediction error variance (geometric mean\, p = 0)\,\nthe unconditional variance (arithmetic mean\, p = 1) and the maximum of the spectrum (p →\n∞). The variance profile provides a useful characterisation of a stochastic process\; we focus in\nparticular on the class of fractionally integrated processes. Moreover\, it enables a direct and\nimmediate derivation of the Szeg¨o-Kolmogorov formula and the interpolation error variance\nformula. The paper proposes a non-parametric estimator of the variance profile based on the\npower mean of the smoothed sample spectrum\, and proves its consistency and its asymptotic\nnormality. From the empirical standpoint\, we propose and illustrate the use of the variance\nprofile for estimating the long memory parameter in climatological and financial time series and\nfor assessing structural change.\n\n<a href="http://ideas.repec.org/e/ppr15.html">Professor Proietti at IDEAS</a>

Our approach involves estimation and inference based on Taylor rules obtained through standard linear regression methods\, but combined using Bayesian model averaging techniques. Employing data that were available in real time\, the estimated version of the ‘meta’ Taylor rule provides a flexible but compelling characterisation of monetary policy in the United States over the last forty years.\n\nThe paper is available from <a href="http://www.economics.unimelb.edu.au/RTAustralianMacroDatabase/Research.html">here.</a>\n\n<a href="http://www.economics.unimelb.edu.au/who/profile.cfm?sid=23">Dr Shields's web page</a>

DESCRIPTION:Title: “Quantile Regressions for Fractional Integration Testing: A case of realized volatility”\n\nAbstract:\n\nIn this paper we propose a quantile regression based test to detect long memory that extends the Lagrange Multiplier test by Breitung and Hassler (2002\, Journal of Econometrics). First\, the new procedure is more powerful under outliers or leptokurtic distributions. Second\, it allows to detect whether the degree of memory or fractional integration varies at different quantiles\, which is particularly useful when one is interested in the tail-behavior of the data. The test is straightforward to apply since the limiting distribution is Gaussian or \\chi^2 and free of nuisance parameters. The validity in finite samples is established through Monte Carlo experiments. The application to daily realized volatility produces new insights into the widely accepted long-memory feature: The model with a constant order of integration is rejected due to persistence growing with increasing quantiles.\n\n<a href="http://www.wiwi.uni-frankfurt.de/ei/index.php?id=1266&L=1%2F">Professor Hassler's webpage</a>

SUMMARY:Professor Hira Koul (Michigan State University) "Model Diagnostics via Khmaladze's Martingale Transform"
LOCATION:Room G19\, Building 6 (Education Building)\, Clayton Campus
DESCRIPTION:Title: "Model Diagnostics via Khmaladze's Martingale Transform"\n\nAbstract: \n\nA classical problem in statistics is to fit a distribution up to unknown location-scale parameters. This problem is generic to many other statistical models including the celebrated regression and autoregressive and generalize autoregressive conditionally heteroscedastic (ARCH-GARCH) models where one is testing that innovations are from a given distribution. It will be argued that the Khamaladze's martingale transformation of the residual empirical process that yields asymptotically distribution free tests for the one sample location-scale model does the same thing for a parametric heteroscedastic regression model\, nonparametric regression models and for ARCH-GARCH models.\n\n<a href="http://www.stt.msu.edu/~koul/">Professor Koul's web page</a>

SUMMARY:Professor Peter Danaher (Department of Marketing: Monash University) - "Assessing the Effectiveness of Mobile Phone Promotions"
LOCATION:Caulfield\, Building H\, Room H4.87
DESCRIPTION:Professor Peter Danaher has recently joined the Department of Marketing at Monash. For more information\, please refer to <a href="http://www.buseco.monash.edu.au/about/staff/profile.php?cn=peter-danaher">http://www.buseco.monash.edu.au/about/staff/profile.php?cn=peter-danaher</a>\n\nTopic: Assessing the Effectiveness of Mobile Phone Promotions\n\nAbstract: A start-up interactive media company in Melbourne\, Australia\, conducted a two-year trial in a shopping mall in which about 5\,500 people were recruited to a panel whereby an RFID tag was attached to their mobile phone. They all opted-in to receive 3 SMS coupons whenever they “swiped” their mobile phone at the mall entrances. Over 150\,000 promotional messages were delivered during the trial\, comprising 40 stores that generated 136 different SMS coupons.  We develop a tri-variate probit model with person and store random effects and estimate the parameters using MCMC estimation. Our findings show there is only about a 1% redemption rate for the coupons. However\, many of the covariates are significant\, showing\, for example\, that snack food promotions are much more successful than men’s clothing. Items of low value\, such as milkshakes and pancakes have much higher redemption rates than shoes and women’s hairdressing. “2 for 1” offers do much better than percentage or dollar discounts. There is also an important store location effect whereby the shorter the distance from the swipe point to the store the more likely a person is to redeem the coupon. Lastly\, there are large heterogeneity effects\, with previous redeemers being much more likely to redeem in the future (people we term “promo junkies”).

For more information\, please refer to <a href="http://sydney.edu.au/business/staff/mohamadk">http://sydney.edu.au/business/staff/mohamadk</a>\n\nSeminar Title: Estimation of Copula Models with Discrete Margins via Bayesian Data Augmentation\n\nAbstract: Estimation of copula models with discrete margins is known to be difficult beyond the bivariate case. We show how this can be achieved by augmenting the likelihood with latent variables\, and computing inference using the resulting augmented posterior. To evaluate this we propose two efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling schemes. One generates the latent variables as a block using a Metropolis-Hasting step with a proposal that is close to its target distribution\, the other generates them one at a time. Our method applies to all parametric copulas where the conditional copula functions can be evaluated\, not just elliptical copulas as in previous Bayesian work. Moreover\, the copula parameters can be estimated joint with any marginal parameters. We establish the effectiveness of the estimation method by modeling consumer behavior in online retail using Archimedean and Gaussian copulas. The example shows that elliptical copulas can be poor at modeling dependence in discrete data\, just as they can be in the continuous case. To demonstrate the potential in higher dimensions we estimate 16 dimensional D-vine copulas for a longitudinal model of usage of a bicycle path in the city of Melbourne\, Australia. The estimates reveal an interesting serial dependence structure that can be represented in a parsimonious fashion using Bayesian selection of independence pair-copula components. Finally\, we extend our results and method to the case where some margins are discrete and others continuous.

For more information\, please refer to <a href="http://www1.feb.uva.nl/pp/mjgbun/">http://www1.feb.uva.nl/pp/mjgbun/.</a>\n\nTitle: Identification in linear dynamic panel data models\n\nAbstract: Neither the Dif(ference) moment conditions\, see Arellano and Bond (1991)\, nor the Lev(el) moment conditions\, see Arellano and Bover (1995) and Blundell and Bond (1998)\, identify the parameters of linear dynamic panel data models for all data generating processes for the initial observations that accord with them when the data is persistent. The combined Dif-Lev (Sys) moment conditions do not always identify the parameters either when there are three time series observations but do so for larger numbers of time series observations. Thus the Sys moment conditions always identify the parameters when there are more than three time series observations. To determine the optimal GMM procedure for analyzing the parameters in linear dynamic panel data models\, we construct the power envelope and find that the KLM statistic from Kleibergen (2005) maximizes the rejection frequency under the worst case alternative hypothesis whilst always being size correct under the null hypothesis.\n\nFor a copy of the paper please click <a href="http://aimsrv1.fee.uva.nl/koen/web.nsf/view/6292B3FBFACD9300C1257952004A1690/$file/1104.pdf">here</a>.

LOCATION:Room H5\, Ground floor Menzies building\, Clayton Campus
DESCRIPTION:Title: Decriminalization and Initiation into Cannabis Use\n\nAbstract: This study exploits variation in the timing of cannabis policy reforms across Australia to determine the impact of decriminalization on initiation into cannabis use. To do so\, we use a unique data set that merges individual level information on drug use with detailed information on cannabis policies from  all Australian jurisdictions. Using a discrete-time hazard approach\, we find that decriminalizing cannabis shifts the age distribution of uptake towards younger ages. In addition\, we provide evidence that the increase in uptake at younger ages is greater the longer the policy of decriminalization has been in place.\n\nProfessor Jenny Williams is a Professor at the University of Melbourne.

SUMMARY:Professor Gianni Amisano (European Central Bank and University of Brescia) - "Prediction with several macromodels"
LOCATION:Room H5\, Ground floor Menzies building\, Clayton Campus
DESCRIPTION:Title: Prediction with several macromodels\n\nAbstract: There are several relevant layers of uncertainty that characterise econometric models routinely used for policy making. First and foremost\, there is intrinsic uncertainty about the future conditional on a model and parameters. Then there is extrinsic uncertainty about model parameters conditional on a model. Then there is uncertainty about models conditional on a set of models. In addition there is unconditional uncertainty\, when all models considered are false. \n\nIn this paper we incorporate all four levels of uncertainty and we assess the improvements in the quality of prediction that we get by doing so. We provide a practical example based on the joint combination of a DSGE model\, a Bayesian VAR and a dynamic factor model for a set of US macroeconomic time series. In our paper we find that : \n1.Taking into consideration parameter uncertainty is most relevant in periods of unusual data. \n2. A pool with equal weights provides predictions of superior quality with respect to prediction obtained with individual models \n3. We introduce a measure of value of each of the models being combined that can be decomposed across sub-periods and this measure provides important indication regarding the usefulness of the individual models. \n\nProfessor Amisano is a Professor of Econometrics at the University of Brescia and a senior economist at the European Central Bank.

DESCRIPTION:Dr Sisson is the Queen Elizabeth II Research Fellow in the School of Mathematics and Statistics at UNSW. For more information\, please refer to <a href="http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~scott/">Dr Sisson's webpage</a>\n\nTitle: Approximate Bayesian Computation in high dimensions\n\nAbstract: Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) has become an increasingly popular techniqe for the fitting of complex Bayesian models when the likelihood function is unavailable or computationally intractable. In the past 10 years it has received widespread application across many different scientific disciplines. ABC methods are simple to use (they were invented by Biologists)\, and have gradually increased in efficiency and sophistication as researchers have begun to understand their properties.\n\nHowever ABC methods suffer greatly from the curse of dimensionality -- as the number model parameters grows\, their performance can deteriorate rapidly. This is problematic as the popularity of ABC means that it is being applied to ever more complex (and higher dimensional) problems. In this presentation\, I will introduce ABC methods and illustrate both their practical utility and their poor performance in high dimensions. I will then discuss some useful ways in which standard ABC techniques may be extended in moderate and higher dimensions\, demonstrating that there is a strong future for ABC methods in applied research.

One way to obtain a confidence set for this coefficient is to invert the Anderson-Rubin test. The "AR confidence sets" that result have correct coverage under classical assumptions. In this paper\, however\, we show that AR confidence sets also have many undesirable properties. Their coverage conditional on quantities that the investigator can observe\, notably the Sargan statistic\, can be far from correct. It is well known that they can be unbounded when the instruments are weak.  Even when they are bounded\, their length may be very misleading. We argue that\, at least when the instruments are not so weak that inference is hopeless\, it is much better to obtain confidence intervals by bootstrapping either the IV or LIML t~statistic on the coefficient of interest in a particular way that we propose.

DESCRIPTION:Title: "Reactive Investment Strategies"\nAbstract\nAsset liability management is a key aspect of the operation of all financial\ninstitutions. In this endeavor\, asset allocation is considered the most important\nelement of investment management. Asset allocation strategies may be\nstatic\, and as such are usually assessed under asset models of various degrees\nof complexity and sophistication. In recent years attention has turned\nto dynamic strategies\, which promise to control risk more effectively.\nIn this paper we present a new class of dynamic asset strategy\, which\nrespond to actual events. Hence they are referred to as ‘reactive’ strategies.\nThey cannot be characterized as a series of specific asset allocations\nover time\, but comprise rules for determining such allocations as the world\nevolves. Though they depend on how asset returns and other financial variables\nare modeled\, they are otherwise objective in nature.\n \nThe resulting strategies are optimal\, in the sense that they can be shown\nto outperform all other strategies of their type when no asset allocation constraints\nare imposed. Where such constraints are imposed\, the strategies may\nbe demonstrated to be almost optimal\, and dramatically more effective than\nstatic strategies.\n \nKeywords: Dynamic asset allocation\; lifecycle investment\; target date\nfunds\; contrarian asset allocation\; dynamic optimization\; calculus of variations

In doing so\, it defines α -Lorenz curves by adapting the generalized Lorenz curves to this case. In addition\, it provides an empirical illustration of these tools using Australian income data for the period 2001–2008. The results suggest that despite the reduction of relative inequality\, inequality increased for most centrist value judgments.

In particular\, we propose a modified penalty function for such criteria\, which implies each break is equivalent to estimation of three individual regression coefficients. A Monte Carlo analysis compares information criteria to sequential testing\, with the modified BIC and HQIC criteria performing well overall\, for DGPs both without and with breaks.

The focus of this paper is the nonparametric estimation of the marginal effects (i.e. first partial derivatives) of an instrumental regression function φ defined by conditional moment restrictions that stem from a structural econometric model E[Y−φ(Z)|W ] = 0\, and involve endogenous variables Y and Z and instruments W . The derivative function φ′ is the solution of an ill-posed inverse problem and we propose an estimation procedure based on\nLandweber-Fridman regularization. The paper presents theoretical properties of the estimated nonparametric instrumental marginal effects\, examines finite-sample performance\, and considers an illustrative application.\n\nFor more info: <a href="http://www.economics.mcmaster.ca/faculty/racinej">http://www.economics.mcmaster.ca/faculty/racinej</a>

SUMMARY:Dr Tomasz Wozniak (Melbourne University)
DESCRIPTION:Title: Granger causal analysis of VARMA-GARCH models\n\nAbstract: Recent economic developments have shown the importance of spillover and contagion effects in financial markets. Such effects are not limited to relations between the levels of financial variables but also impact on the volatility. I investigate Granger causality in conditional mean and conditional variances of time series. For this purpose a VARMA-GARCH process is used. I derive parametric restrictions for the hypothesis of noncausality in conditional variances between two groups of variables\, when there are other variables in the system  as well. These novel conditions are convenient for the analysis of potentially big systems of economic variables. Such systems should be considered in order to avoid the problem of omitted variable bias. Further\, I apply a Bayesian procedure in order to test the restrictions. The test avoids the singularity problem that may appear in classical Wald tests. Also\, it relaxes the assumption of existence of higher order moments of the residuals.\n\n\nDr Wozniak has recently joined the Department of Economics at the University of Melbourne.

SUMMARY:Professor Jan Kiviet (University of Amsterdam and the National University of Technology\, Singapore) - Course
DESCRIPTION:Monte Carlo simulation for econometricians: methods\, accuracy\, methodology\n\nMany studies in econometric theory are supplemented by Monte Carlo simulation investigations. These illustrate the properties of alternative inference techniques when applied to samples drawn from mostly entirely synthetic data generating processes. They should provide information on how techniques\, which may be sound asymptotically\, perform in finite samples. Ideally they unveil how the major properties of inference procedures depend on characteristics of the modelled data generating process and the magnitude of nuisance parameters\, especially when these dependencies are too complex to derive analytically.\nThis short course addresses the fundamentals of conceiving and executing such simulation studies and focuses with hands-on EViews and Matlab illustrations on:\n1. Assessment by simulation of the major characteristics of estimators and test statistics such as first and second moments\, cumulative distribution functions\, tail probabilities and quantiles.\n2. Analysis of the determining factors of the accuracy of simulation assessments of the bias and root mean squared errors of estimators and the rejection probabilities of test statistics. This leads to rules of thumb regarding the required number of simulation replications.\n3. Designing effective and efficient simulation studies\, with special attention to: organizing fair tournaments between competing techniques\, transforming the parameter space of a synthetic data generating process into a simulation design parameter space with useful orthogonality properties and reduced dimensionality.\n4. Discussion of options for dedicated simulation studies based on actual empirical data and a postulated actual data generation process\, and of the differences in purpose and achievements of Monte Carlo simulation with related techniques such as Monte Carlo testing and bootstrapping.

SUMMARY:Professor Jan Kiviet (University of Amsterdam and the National University of Technology\, Singapore)
DESCRIPTION:Title: Exploiting strong instruments unduly neglected by standard GMM\n\nAbstract: While coping with non-sphericity of the disturbances\, GMM suffers from a blind spot for exploiting the strongest possible instruments. In this study it is demonstrated that its established optimality is achieved over a too inflexible interpretation of the adopted moment restrictions. In particular\, GMM does not automatically respect the golden rule that exogenous regressors establish their own strongest possible instruments. For some typical cross-section and dynamic panel data models it is shown by simulation that under moderate heteroskedasticity straight-forward modifications of the exploited set of instruments\, which respect just the very same population moment conditions\, can achieve very substantial reductions in both bias and variance in finite samples. That feasible adapted implementations of GMM as proposed here have profound positive effects on the significance of inference in models with non-spherical disturbances is illustrated also by estimating a micro employment equation for a panel of UK companies.\n\nFor more information\, please refer to <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/homepagejfk/">https://sites.google.com/site/homepagejfk/.</a>

SUMMARY:Professor Christian Robert (CREST and University of Dauphine\, Paris) - "ABC methods for Bayesian model choice"
LOCATION:Room E457\, Menzies Building\, Clayton Campus
DESCRIPTION:ABC methods for Bayesian model choice\n\nApproximate Bayesian computation (ABC) have become a essential tool for the analysis of complex stochastic models. Having implemented ABC-based model choice in a wide range of phylogenetic models in the DIY-ABC software (Cornuet et al.\, 2008)\, we first present theoretical background as to why a generic use of ABC for model choice is ungrounded\, since it depends on an unknown amount of information loss induced by the use of a summary statistic (Robert et al.\, 2011). We then present necessary and sufficient conditions on the summary statistics for ABC based model choice procedure to be consistent\, a solution that avoids the call to additional empirical verifications of the performances of the ABC procedure as those available in DIYABC and advocated in Ratman et al. (2011).

SUMMARY:Professor MJ Lee (Korea University) "Quasi-Difference in Differences with Panel Data: Complete Pairing and Least Squares Estimator
LOCATION:Seminar Room 4.87\, 4th floor\, H Building\, Caulfield Campus
DESCRIPTION:Title: Quasi-Difference in Differences with Panel Data: Complete Pairing and Least Squares Estimator\n\nAbstract:\nWith one treated and one untreated periods\, difference in differences (DD) requires a ‘zero selection-effect condition’ that the untreated response changes be the same across the treatment and control groups\, if the treatment were withheld contrary to the fact. A natural way to check the condition is to backtrack one period and examine the response changes in two pre-treatment periods. If the condition does not hold in the pre-treatment periods\, then under the assumption that the pre-treatment gap will persist\, the modified DD takes the form of ‘quasi-difference in differences (QD)’\, which is ‘triple differences’ with one additional time-wise difference. QD generalizes DD with a weaker identification condition: a timeconstant\, but not necessarily zero\, selection effect\; QD is also less vulnerable to a clustered data problem often plaguing DD. This paper addresses how to test whether the pre-treatment gap is persistent or not with panel data\, and how to modify DD with QD accordingly. Nonparametric estimators/tests and panel linear-model-based LSE/tests are proposed\, and a simulation study is presented.\n\nFor more information\, click on <a href="http://rse.anu.edu.au/people/people.php?ID=2381">http://rse.anu.edu.au/people/people.php?ID=2381</a>

LOCATION:Room E457\, Menzies Building\, Clayton Campus
DESCRIPTION:Title: That P-values should be regarded as being like a Birmingham screwdriver\, and likelihood ratios should be used instead\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe Neyman-Pearson approach to hypothesis testing is an important brick in the foundations of the classical approach to statistical inference. I consider it to be unsatisfactory because most Neyman-Pearson tests between simple hypotheses can be criticised by relevant betting procedures.  Such betting procedures appears to offer a profit margin to a person quoting Fisher-Neyman-Pearson confidence levels but have positive expectation under both hypotheses to the person criticising those confidence levels. \n\nA simple change to make hypothesis tests more sensible is to add a third region of the sample space where no conclusion is drawn\, while retaining the two commonly-used regions where one hypothesis is rejected.  This change leads to the conclusions that likelihood ratios should be used rather than classical confidence levels as measures of strength of evidence\; that Wald's sequential probability ratio test should be modified\; and that for pure hypothesis testing\, where there is no defined alternative hypothesis\, tail probabilities should be approximately converted into likelihood ratios and these should be quoted as indicators of statistical significance. \n\nThe practical impact of this alternative approach will be illustrated using two epidemiological trials.  The academic impact will be discussed relative to the ideas in Kuhn’s book “The Structure of Scientific Revolutions”.\n\n<a href="http://www.cmis.csiro.au/geoff.robinson/">http://www.cmis.csiro.au/geoff.robinson/</a>

Under a sparsity assumption\, we derive nonasymptotic oracle inequalities for both the prediction risk and `1 estimation loss for regression coefficients. Furthermore\, we establish conditions under which the unknown threshold parameter can be estimated at nearly n rate when the number of regressors can be much larger than the sample size (n). We illustrate the usefulness of our proposed estimation method via Monte Carlo simulations and an application to real data.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker <a href="http://www.utas.edu.au/economics-finance/people/Firmin-Doko-Tchatoka">Dr Firmin Doko Tchatoka (University of Tasmania)</a>\n\nTitle: "Testing for Partial Exogeneity with Weak Identification"\n\nAbstract:\n\n"We consider the following problem. A structural equation of interest\ncontains two sets of explanatory variables which economic theory\npredicts may be endogenous. The researcher is interested in testing\nthe exogeneity of only one of them. Standard exogeneity tests are in\ngeneral unreliable from the view point of size control to assess such\na problem. We develop four alternative tests to address this issue in\na convenient way. We provide a characterization of their distributions\nunder both the null hypothesis (level) and the alternative hypothesis\n(power)\, with or without identification. We show that the usual\nchi-squared critical values are still applicable even when\nidentification is weak. So\, all proposed tests can be described as\nrobust to weak instruments. We also show that test consistency may\nstill hold even if the overall identification fails\, provided partial\nidentification is satisfied. We present a Monte Carlo experiment which\nconfirms our theory. We illustrate our theory with the widely\nconsidered returns to education example. The results underscore: (1)\nhow the use of standard tests to assess partial exogeneity hypotheses\nmay be misleading\, and (2) the relevance of using our procedures when\nchecking for partial exogeneity."

LOCATION:Room E457\, Menzies Building\, Clayton Campus
DESCRIPTION:Title: “Identification using stability restrictions”\n \nAbstract: Structural change\, typically induced by policy regime shifts\, is a common feature of dynamic economic models. We show that structural change can be used constructively to improve the identification of structural parameters that are stable over time. A leading example is models that are immune to the well-known Lucas (1976) critique. This insight is used to develop novel econometric methods that extend the widely used generalized  method of moments (GMM). The proposed methods yield improved inference on the parameters of a leading macroeconomic policy model\, the new Keynesian Phillips curve.\n \nKeywords: GMM\, identification\, structural stability\, Lucas critique.\n \nJEL: C22\, E31\n\nFor more information\, <a href="http://www.business.uwa.edu.au/contact/econ?type=profile&dn=cn%3DLeandro%20Magnusson%2Cou%3DEconomics%2Cou%3DUWA%20Business%20School%2Cou%3DFaculty%20of%20Business%20(UWA%20Business%20School)%2Cou%3DFaculties%2Co%3DThe%20University%20of%20Western%20Australia">http://www.business.uwa.edu.au/contact/econ?type=profile&dn=cn%3DLeandro%20Magnusson%2Cou%3DEconomics%2Cou%3DUWA%20Business%20School%2Cou%3DFaculty%20of%20Business%20(UWA%20Business%20School)%2Cou%3DFaculties%2Co%3DThe%20University%20of%20Western%20Australia.</a>

LOCATION:Room H4.87 Caulfield Campus
DESCRIPTION:Title: Regime-Switching Heston's Stochastic Volatility Model and Option Price\n \nAbstract:\n \nIn this article we suggest and estimate regime-switching Heston's stochastic volatility model by maximum likelihood estimation method. Because the likelihood function for the Heston (1993) model is not known\, we construct an approximate log-likelihood function by using the irreducible method suggested by Aït-Sahalia (2008). In our model\, the parameters are allowed to change to incorporate the possible regime shifts in the underlying data generating process of the data. We use the S&P 500 index for the stock price and the VIX data to compute proxy for the volatility state variable. The unobservable regime state variable follows a continuous time first order Markov chain and the transition probabilities depend on the state variable. The recursive algorithm developed by Hamilton (1989) is applied to compute likelihood in order to conduct MLE. We found a strong evidence for regime shifts in the data. And then we use the resulting estimates to compute option prices to investigate implication of our model in terms of option pricing.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Improved Tests for Spatial Correlation\n \nPeter M. Robinson and Francesca Rossi\n \nAbstract: We consider testing the null hypothesis of no spatial autocorrelation against the alternative of first order spatial autoregression. A Wald test statistic has good first-order asymptotic properties\, but these may not be relevant in small or moderate-sized samples\, especially as (depending on properties of the spatial weight matrix) the usual parametric rate of convergence may not be attained. We thus develop tests with more accurate size properties\, by means of Edgeworth expansions and the bootstrap. The finite-sample performance of the tests is examined in Monte Carlo simulations.

LOCATION:Room H4.87\, Caulfield Campus
DESCRIPTION:Title: When does seasonality change? A Synchrosqueezing approach to analyzing the dynamics of the seasonality.\n\nAbstract:\nSeasonality is a feature aimed to describe the oscillatory pattern\ninside an observed signal\, for example\, the incidence time series.\nIdentifying seasonality from a observed noisy signal is an important\nissue in many scientific fields\, such as public health and economics.\nSeveral methods\, for example\, seasonal autoregressive integrated\nmoving average (SARIMA)\, frequency analysis (FFT)\, seasonal index\,\nsingular spectrum analysis (SSA)\, etc\, are available to identify the\nseasonality. However\, it is not an easy task to analyze the dynamical\nbehavior of the seasonality by these methods. For example\, how to\nquantify the influence of the general appliance of varicella vaccine\non the seasonal behavior of varicella itself and herpes zoster?\nThe purpose of this study is to provide a general model describing the\ndynamics of the seasonality and introduce an adaptive method\, referred\nto as the Synchrosqueezing transform\, to extract accurately the\nseasonality from a given time varying signal. The identifiability\nproblem of the model and the robustness property of Synchrosqueezing\ntransform to dependent noise is theoretically analyzed. We directly\napply this method to analyze the incidence time series of varicella\nand herpes zoster and show the dynamics of the seasonality introduced\nby the general appliance of varicella vaccine. This is joint work with\nYu-Chun Chen and Hau-Tieng Wu.

DESCRIPTION:Growth Effects of International Financial Integration\n\nMichael Binder\, Goethe University Frankfurt\nGeorgios Georgiadis\, European Central Bank\nSunil Sharma\, International Monetary Fund\n\nThe paper investigates the growth effects of international financial integration\, and their dependence on two key factors - country governance quality and the level of domestic financial market development. To capture such conditionality\, a class of dynamic panel data models with conditionally pooled coefficients is proposed. The econometric framework takes account of short- and long-run dynamics\, cross-country heterogeneity\, cross-sectional dependence\, and the potential endogeneity of international financial integration. Novel indices of governance quality and domestic financial market development\, that can capture these two factors for a panel involving 78 industrial\, emerging market and developing countries for the time period from 1970 to 2009\, are used. The estimation results suggest that the growth effects of international fi…nancial integration vary critically with the level of governance quality and domestic financial market development.

DESCRIPTION:Title:  How Well Does “Core” CPI Capture Permanent Price Changes?\n \nAbstract:  Does a measure excluding food and energy prices from the overall consumer price index (CPI) capture the persistent partof the CPI?  In order to examine thisclaim we decompose “core” (excluding food and energy) CPI and the food andenergy CPI measures into permanent and transitory components using a correlated unobserved components model. We findthat shocks to the permanent component of core CPI are more volatile than shocks to core CPI.  This is possible because the permanent and transitory shocks to core CPI are highly negatively correlated.  We further find that the excluded food and energy components have important permanent components that are not captured by core CPI.  We examine impulse response functions and find that overall CPI inflation responds more sharply to shocks than core CPI inflation\, and after the first year the impactof shocks on overall inflation is less than the impact on core inflation. In conclusion we find that core CPI is not smooth because it excludes volatile temporary movements but rather because it experiences volatile permanent shocks with off setting transitory movements.

DESCRIPTION:Forecasting with micro panels: The case of health care costs\n \nAbstract: Micro panels characterized by large numbers of individuals observed over a short time period provide a rich source of information but as yet there is only limited experience in using such data for forecasting.  We exploit the linkage of a cohort-representative survey of more than 250\,000 Australians aged 45 and over to several years of hospital\, medical and pharmaceutical records. After calculating total health care cost for each survey respondent\, we explore the relative forecasting performance of alternative models of health expenditures. In contrast to much of the risk adjustment literature\, where such modelling is prevalent\, the availability of panel data allows the use of a fixed effects approach in order to guard against possible omitted variable biases associated with unobservable individual specific effects. This is motivated by the well-established preference for using fixed effects when parameter estimation is the main objective. While existing simulation evidence also supports the use of a fixed effects approach when forecasting\, we demonstrate this is a fragile conclusion that is likely to be overturned in many situations\, including our models of health care costs. Simulation results add support and additional insights into the results obtained in the application.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Copula Modeling of Dependence in Multivariate Time Series\n \nAbstract\nNonlinear models are increasingly preferred over linear ones in multivariate time series analysis. However\, almost all such models remain linear at any given point in time\, or conditional on latent regime variables. In this paper an alternative is proposed\, where nonlinear serial and cross-sectional dependence is accounted for directly using a copula model. A D-vine copula is used for the joint distribution of the series\, which is a product of bivariate `pair-copulas'.  By blocking these pair-copulas together\, the conditional and marginal densities of the multivariate time series can be expressed analytically\, and simple conditions for stationarity derived. The copula representation also has the advantage that it is parsimonious for series that are Markovian. A parallel algorithm for computing the likelihood is given\, along with a Bayesian approach for computing the full range of inference\, including predictive distributions. A two level model selection prior is employed\, where the first level places point mass on the Markov order\, and the second accounts for multiplicity in the number of pair-copulas in each block. The resulting model average estimates of the dependence structure are shown to be more accurate in a simulation study. Two five-dimensional time series from the Australian electricity market are examined. The first shows how the approach extends existing copula models for multivariate extremes to also account for serial dependence\, while the second illustrates the flexibility of the proposed nonlinear time series model.

In particular\, a function scrap is observed only over a subinterval of the common domain\, and the subintervals are generally different for different scraps. Functional data of this type are increasingly common.  We shall suggest new methods for reconstructing the whole functions\, and for building classifiers for function scraps.

DESCRIPTION:Title: \nNonparametric Stochastic Discount Factor Decomposition.\n\nAbstract: \nThis paper introduces new econometric tools to evaluate asset pricing models and to study long-term risk and pricing in dynamic Markov environments. The approach is nonparametric in the sense that it does not require the researcher to specify the dynamics of the fundamental economic variables within a model\, thereby allowing the researcher to remain agnostic about the presence and form of rare disasters\, jumps\, fat tails\, and other phenomena. Nonparametric sieve estimators of the principal eigenfunction\, principal eigenvalue\, long-term yields\, and entropy of the permanent component that are coherent with a calibrated or estimated SDF and data on fundamentals are proposed. Identification\, consistency\, rates of convergence and asymptotic distribution of the estimators are established under general conditions. These results have wider application to the identification and nonparametric  estimation of the positive eigenfunction of an unknown positive operator. These estimators are applied to investigate U.S. aggregate consumption data in a simple consumption CAPM framework.

The present paper shows how the use of GLS rather than OLS detrended data when testing for a unit root in panels not only leads to reduced power\, but actually has an order effect on the neighborhood around unit for which local asymptotic power is negligible.

DESCRIPTION:Title: \nComputing highly accurate frequentist confidence limits from discrete data\n\nAbstract: \nFor discrete data\, frequentist confidence limits based on a normal approximation to standard likelihood based pivotal quantities can perform poorly even for quite large sample sizes. To construct exact limits requires the probability of a suitable tail set as a function of the unknown parameters. In this paper\, importance sampling (also known as the scoring method) is used to estimate this surface and hence the confidence limits. The technology is simple and straightforward to implement. Unlike the recent methodology of Garthwaite and Jones (2009)\, the new method allows for nuisance parameters\; is an order of magnitude more efficient than the Robbins-Monro bound\; does not require any simulation phases or tuning constants\; gives a straightforward simulation standard error for the target limit\; includes a simple diagnostic for simulation breakdown. Future research will investigate other applications of the scoring method to statistical problems.

DESCRIPTION:Title: \nMoving Average Stochastic Volatility Models with Application to Inflation Forecast\n\nAbstract:  \nMoving average and stochastic volatility are two important components for modeling and forecasting macroeconomic and financial time series. The former aims to capture short-run dynamics\, whereas the latter allows for volatility clustering and time-varying volatility. We introduce a new class of models that includes both of these useful features. The new models allow the conditional mean process to have a state space form. As such\, this general framework includes a wide variety of popular specifications\, including the unobserved components and time-varying parameter models. Having a moving average process\, however\, means that the errors in the measurement equation are no longer serially independent\, and estimation becomes more difficult. We develop a posterior simulator that builds upon recent advances in precision-based algorithms for estimating this new class of models. In an empirical application involving U.S. inflation we find that these moving average stochastic volatility models provide better in-sample fitness and out-of-sample forecast performance than the standard variants with only stochastic volatility.

DESCRIPTION:Title: \nCopula based factorization in bayesian multivariate infinite mixture models\n\nAbstract: \nBayesian nonparametric models based on infinite mixtures of density kernels have been recently gaining in popularity due to their flexibility and feasibility of implementation even in complicated modeling scenarios. In economics\, they have been particularly useful in estimating nonparametric distributions of latent variables. However\, these models have been rarely applied in more than one dimension. Indeed\, the multivariate case suffers from the curse of dimensionality\, with a rapidly increasing number of parameters needed to jointly characterize each mixing component. In this paper\, we propose a factorization scheme for nonparametric mixture models whereby each marginal dimension in the mixing parameter space is modeled separately\, linked by a nonparametric random copula function. Specifically\, we consider nonparametric univariate Gaussian mixtures for the marginals and a multivariate random Bernstein polynomial copula for the link function\, under Dirichlet process priors. We show that this scheme leads to an improvement in the precision of a density estimate in finite samples\, providing a suitable tool for applications in higher dimensions. We derive weak posterior consistency of the copula-based mixing scheme for general kernel types under high-level conditions\, and strong posterior consistency for the specific Bernstein-Gaussian mixture model.

The proposed bootstrap achieves sharp asymptotic refinements for t tests and confidence intervals based on such estimators. Furthermore\, my bootstrap is robust to possible model misspecification\, i.e.\, it achieves asymptotic refinements regardless of whether the assumed moment condition model is correctly specified or not. This result is new\, because asymptotic refinements of the bootstrap for EL estimators have not been established in the literature even under correct model specification.

DESCRIPTION:Title: \nAnalysing Occupancy Surveys\n\nAbstract:\nOccupancy surveys are surveys of sites which are designed to collect data for the purpose of either estimating the proportion of sites that are occupied or modelling the probability that a site is occupied by a particular animal species.   The standard approach (MacKenzie et al\, 2006) recognises that the binary occupancy variable may be measured with error\, assuming particularly that a site may be occupied without the species being detected on the site.  This situation is handled by assuming that the occupancy status of a site does not change over a period of time and then making multiple visits to at least some sites over that period.  Data collected in this way can then be used to model the probability of detection and hence to adjust the estimates of occupancy for potential nondetection. \n\nWe show that occupancy models are more difficult to fit than is generally appreciated because the estimating equations often have multiple solutions\, including boundary estimates which produce fitted probabilities of zero or one.  The estimates are unstable when the data are sparse\, making them difficult to interpret\, and\, even in ideal situations\, highly variable.  As a consequence\, making accurate inference is difficult.  When abundance varies over sites (which is the general rule in ecology because we expect spatial variance in abundance) and detection depends on abundance\, the standard analysis suffers bias (attenuation in detection\, biased estimates of occupancy and potentially finding misleading relationships between occupancy and other covariates)\, asymmetric sampling distributions\, and slow convergence of the sampling distributions to normality.  The biases are of similar magnitude to those obtained when we ignore non-detection entirely. The fact that abundance is subject to detection error and hence is not directly observable\, means that we cannot tell when bias is present and we cannot adjust for it.  This implies that trying to adjust occupancy models for non-detection can be as misleading as ignoring non-detection completely.\n\nThis is joint work with D.B. Lindemayer  and C.F. Donnelly

DESCRIPTION:Title: \n"Bayesian Treatment Effects Models with Variable Selection for Panel Outcomes with an Application to Earnings Effects of Maternity Leave" (joint with Helga Wagner and Sylvia Fruehwirth-Schnatter).\n\nAbstract: \nChild birth leads to a break in a woman’s employment history and is considered one reason for the relatively poor labor market outcomes observed for women compared to men. However\, the time spent at home varies significantly across women. The decision to return to work is likely driven by observed and more importantly unobserved factors that also affect labor market outcomes directly. \nIn this paper we exploit the variation in time spent at home as a result of a recent change in the parental leave policy in Austria  in the context of a Bayesian treatment effects models for binary treatment and panel outcomes.\nWe propose two modeling frameworks based on the potential outcome framework that differ in their modeling of the endogeneity of the treatment and the panel structure of the earnings\, the first based on the modeling tradition of the Roy switching regression\, and the second based on the factor approach. We discuss how stochastic variable selection can be implemented within both modeling frameworks and can be used for example to test for the heterogeneity of the treatment effects. Our empirical analysis of the panel earnings effects from long maternity leave is based on a large sample of mothers the Austrian Social Security Register (ASSD).

DESCRIPTION:Title:\nSome aspects of Machine Learning methods for time series forecasting\n\nAbstract:\nI'll present a study where we examined model estimation of regime switching models. Concretely\, we worked with the neuro-coefficient smooth transition autoregressive model (NCSTAR)\, and used a special type of genetic algorithm (memetic algorithm with local search chains\, MA-LS-Chains) for model estimation.\n\nWe then had a look into evaluation procedures for forecasting methods\, from a Computer Science perspective where for classification and regression the standard procedure is k-fold cross-validation with quadratic error measures. Here\, I present a study on the use of different cross-validation techniques for predictor evaluation\, and a study where these ideas are extended to directional accuracy measures.\n\nDuring the work on the PhD thesis\, 3 packages for R were developed. A neural network package called RSNNS\, a package called Rmalschains which implements the MA-LS-Chains genetic algorithm and a package called tsExpKit which is a toolkit/framework for time series experiments\, containing among other things implementations of the discussed evaluation procedures.

DESCRIPTION:Title: \nImproving forecasting by estimating time series structural components across multiple frequencies\n\nAbstract: \nIdentifying the appropriate time series model to achieve good forecasting accuracy and bias is not straightforward. We propose a novel algorithm that aims to mitigate the importance of model selection\, while increasing accuracy. From the original time series\, using temporal aggregation\, multiple time series are constructed. These derivative series highlight different aspects of the original data\, as temporal aggregation helps in strengthening or attenuating the signals of different time series components. In each series the appropriate exponential smoothing method is fitted and its respective time series components are forecasted. Subsequently\, the time series components from each aggregation level are combined\, and then used to construct the final forecast. This approach achieves better estimation of the different time series components\, through temporal aggregation and mitigates the importance of model selection through forecast combination. Empirical evaluation of the proposed framework demonstrates significant improvements in forecasting accuracy and bias\, especially for long-term forecasts.

DESCRIPTION:Title: \nAn evaluation of simple forecasting model selection rules\n\nAbstract:\nA major problem for many organisational forecasters is to choose the appropriate forecasting method for a large number of data series. Model selection aims to identify the best method of forecasting for an individual series within the data set. Various selection rules have been proposed in order to enhance forecasting accuracy. In theory\, model selection is appealing\, as no single extrapolation method is better than all others for all series in an organizational data set. However\, empirical results have demonstrated limited effectiveness of these often complex rules. The current study explores the circumstances under which model selection is beneficial. Three measures are examined for characterising the data series\, namely predictability (in terms of the relative performance of the random walk but also a method\, theta\, that performs well)\, trend and seasonality in the series. In addition\, the attributes of the data set and the methods also affect selection performance\, including the size of the pools of methods under consideration\, the stability of methods’ performance and the correlation between methods. In order to assess the efficacy of model selection in the cases considered\, simple selection rules are proposed\, based on within-sample best fit or best forecasting performance for different forecast horizons. Individual (per series) selection is contrasted against the simpler approach (aggregate selection)\, where one method is applied to all data series. Moreover\, simple combination of methods also provides an operational benchmark. The analysis shows that individual selection works best when specific sub-populations of data are considered (trended or seasonal series)\, but also when methods’ relative performance is stable over time or no method is dominant across the data series.

A better understanding of home food production can be used to help explain shortcomings in current nutrition policies and consequently help in designing better nutrition policies. This paper provides results from several home meal production function specifications that are rather robust. The median returns to scale and elasticity of substitution between money and time is in the 1.2 to 1.9 range and .33 to .56 range\, respectively\, indicating increasing returns to scale but difficulty in substituting money for time in home meal production. A home ‘meal poverty rate’ is estimated\, which is the percentage of the sample that produces fewer meals at home than consistent with dietary guidelines. The estimated home meal poverty rate is about 85%\, which is consistent with recent research taking a less rigorous approach. Though the approach taken here is novel\, the overall message is consistent with the recent literature: time is a more important factor in achieving nutritional targets than money.

Based on a large dataset of countries from Standard and Poor’s and Moody’s\, we find strong statistical evidence of a large ratings premium–nearly two notches–for those oil producing countries with a large share of net oil revenue to gross domestic product\, relative to countries with similar economic fundamentals. We have some limited forecast information from the rating agencies and the effect increases when we include this information\, providing further evidence that this ratings premium is not driven by expected improvements in fundamentals. This finding has significant implications for asset prices in oil-producing countries and highlights the risk that in the event of a sharp unanticipated drop in oil prices\, sovereign rating downgrades of oil-producing countries could be sharper than the\ndeterioration in their economic fundamentals.

The kernel method is popular and applicable to dependent data\, including time series and spatial data. But at least for the joint density\, one has had to assume that data are observed at regular time intervals or on a regular grid in space. Though this is not very restrictive in the time series case\, it often is in the spatial case. In fact\, to a large degree it has precluded applications of nonparametric methods to statistical and econometric modelling and computation for spatial data because such data often are irregularly positioned over space.\n\nIn this paper\, we propose nonparametric kernel estimators for both the marginal and in particular the joint probability density functions for non-gridded spatial data. Large sample distributions of the proposed estimators are established under mild conditions\, and a new framework of expanding-domain infill asymptotics is suggested to overcome the shortcomings of spatial asymptotics in the existing literature. A practical\, reasonable selection of the bandwidths on the basis of cross-validation is also proposed. We illustrate by both simulations and real data examples of moderate sample size that the proposed methodology is effective and useful in uncovering nonlinear spatial dependence for general\, including non-Gaussian\, distributions.\n\nThis is a joint work with Dag Tjostheim.

These traditional statistics often do not exhibit good robustness properties so trimming either the underlying sample or the kernel values can provide more robust alternatives.\n\nConditions that ensure the trimmed U-statistic is asymptotically normally distributed were established by Janssen et al. (1987)\, however the general limiting behaviour can\n\nbe more complex. This was noted by Stigler (1973) for the case of the trimmed mean. We will explore these ideas for trimmed U-statistics.\n\nFurther\, other widely used robust estimators of location and spread\, such as the Hodges-Lehmann estimator and Qn introduced by Rousseeuw and Croux (1993)\, can be expressed as quantiles of U-statistic kernel values. This connection allows application of the asymptotics for U-processes to establish the asymptotic behaviour of these statistics. These observations will be applied to obtain the asymptotics of a new U-quantile based robust measure of spread. This talk is based on joint works with Yuri Borovskikh\, Samuel Muller and Garth Tarr.

To develop the test\, a sequence of systematic samples are defined via the Walsh functions. Then the deviations of the autocovariances based on these systematic samples from the corresponding autocovariances of the whole time series are calculated and the uniformly asymptotic joint normality of these deviations over different systematic samples is obtained. With a double order selection scheme\, our test statistic is constructed by combining the deviations at different lags in the systematic samples. The null asymptotic distribution of the proposed statistic is derived and the consistency of the test is shown under fixed and local alternatives. Simulation studies demonstrate well-behaved finite sample properties of the proposed method. Favorable comparisons with the test of Dette et al. (2011) in terms of power are shown analytically and illustrated empirically. In addition\, the proposed method is applied to check the stationarity assumption of a chemical process viscosity readings data.

Testing Alternative Measures of National Wellbeing\n\nAbstract:\nMany aggregate measures of wellbeing and sustainability exist to guide policy-makers. However\, the power of these aggregate measures to predict objective wellbeing outcomes has received little comparative testing. We compile and compare a range of aggregate wellbeing measures including: material measures (e.g. Gross Domestic Product per capita)\, surveyed measures (e.g. life satisfaction) and composite measures (e.g. Human Development Index) covering a range of countries. We test the predictive power of wellbeing measures for an objective indicator of how people value countries’ relative attractiveness. The objective indicator is net migration over a fifty year timespan\, indicating people’s revealed preference (re)location choices. The paper examines relationships amongst cross-country wellbeing and sustainability measures\; and examines how New Zealand compares with other countries according to these measures. Based on models of spatial (dis)equilibrium and migration\, we present tests of the predictive power of alternative aggregate measures for international migration outcomes. We find that both material and life satisfaction outcomes are important determinants of the choice to migrate.

It utilises a nationally representative data set\, recent matching techniques\, and IV estimation methods to evaluate conditional and unconditional quantile treatment effects for education and for migrant status. Particular attention is paid to rural-migrant wage differentials and the migration effect on earnings. The evidence indicates that (1) the returns to education are significant\, especially when we account for endogeneity\; (2) long-term migrants seem disadvantaged\, mainly due to endowment effects\, and (3) the urban-rural migrant wage gap completely disappears when matching or IV methods are employed to account for endogeneity in education.\n\nThe paper appears in China Economic Review: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X13000254

DESCRIPTION:Clayton campus simulcast: E365 - lvl 3\, Menzies Building 11\n\nTitle:\nEstimating the Dimensionality of Latent Structural Models \n\nAbstract:\nPublic opinion scholar Philip Converse once wrote that political ideological belief systems "have often served as primary exhibits for the doctrine that what is important to study cannot be measured and that what can be measured is not important to study." An important and often unfortunate characteristic of the social and behavioral sciences is that most theories depend heavily on the classification of units according to such difficult to measure abstract latent constructs --- such as  ideology\, religiosity\, socioeconomic status\, economic development\, and corruption --- which defy direct\, objective observation.  Recovering these underlying (continuous) traits or (categorical) types requires the specification of a structural model that relates the many observed indicators which partially reflect the abstract concepts to a very specific structure of underlying latent variables.  \n\nBut one of the many requirements for these models is that the dimensionality of these latent variables\, which is often subject to debate\, is known a priori.  As Peter Green poignantly observed\, "one of the things you do not know is the number of things you do not know." Directly assessing the dimensionality though is often quite difficult\; consequently\, researchers frequently resort to comparing measures of fit for separately estimated models\, with the limitation that one can only consider a few specifications.  \n\nIn this paper\, I focus on models applied to binary and ordered observed items and allow for either an unordered or ordered structure among discrete typologies (latent classes). The Bayesian latent class model applied here  simultaneously determines the number of latent categories as well as the classification of units to the categories.  In this implementation\, the number of classes is determined within the model through a random jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo step.  Applications include the  political ideology type of survey respondents\, coalitions of legislators and the typology of the political regimes of countries.

SUMMARY:Dr Stefanie Schurer (RMIT)
DESCRIPTION:What's the Point of Class? Random Coefficients versus Latent Class Models\n\nRecent applied work using panel data have postulated that heterogeneity in intercept and slope parameters arises due to the fact that the sample is drawn from a finite mixture of populations\, each having their own responses\, see e.g. Deb (2001)\, Trivedi and Deb (2002)\,Winkelmann (2004)\, Bago d'Uva (2005\, 2006)\, Clark et al. (2005)\, Halliday (2008) and Harris and Sosa-Rubí (2009). The resulting estimator uses a finite number of mass points to non-parametrically determine the latent classes\, which is then identical to the non-parametric maximum likelihood estimator (NPMLE). The found classes are often interpreted as high users and low users\, or the sick and the healthy and separate marginal effects of e.g. income are estimated for the groups. However\, using longitudinal data\, groups are only identified by the non-parametric maximum likelihood estimator (NPMLE) if there is no further unobserved heterogeneity within the groups. As is well known\, the NPMLE can approximate general unobserved heterogeneity distributions well. The question then arises as to whether we truly do have latent classes in the population\, or whether are we simply approximating a (continuous) heterogeneity distribution? We will attempt to distinguish these two using recent developments in Bayesian estimation\, using MCMC.

DESCRIPTION:GEERT MESTERS (VU University\, Amsterdam)\n\nURL (with link to CV): http://geertmesters.nl/\n\nTitle: "Dynamic Factor Models with Stochastic Loadings"\n\nAbstract: We consider the dynamic factor model for the case where the rows of the loading matrix\, the dynamic factors and the idiosyncratic processes are treated as latent stochastic processes. Three results are discussed that enable the efficient estimation of the loadings\, factors and the parameter vector. First\, we provide an iterative algorithm to evaluate the conditional modes of the loadings and the factors. Second\, we show that the marginal likelihood can be accurately evaluated analytically using a convenient importance sampling representation. Third\, we show that the conditional mean and variance for the loadings and the factors can be calculated using basic simulation methods. In particular\, we calculate the integral over the factors analytically and evaluate the remaining loading-dependent terms via importance sampling. The methods are systematically investigated in a Monte Carlo study where we document the finite sample properties and compare the methods with existing procedures. The new methods are further illustrated in two empirical applications (i) for the term structure of interest rates and (ii) for business cycle modeling.

DESCRIPTION:JUN SUNG KIM (Cornell University)\nURL (with link to CV): http://www.junsungkim.com/\n\nTitle: ''A Structural Model of Multigraph Formation: Favor Exchange and Social Networks in Villages'\n\nAbstract: This paper proposes a structural model of multigraph formation\, where 1) individuals determine two or more types of links simultaneously\; 2) all networks interact with each other in the sense that the structure of one network affects an individual's utility from the other networks\; and 3) one or more networks are endogenous but not simultaneous from the econometrician's perspective. I extend the notion of pairwise stability of a single network in Jackson and Wolinsky (1996) to a multigraph\, and show that the structural model is equivalent to a multinomial choice model under pairwise stability of a multigraph. The presence of endogenous but not simultaneously determined networks is a source of an incomplete econometric model. Relying on the recent development of partially identified econometric models\, I characterize the sharp identification region of utility parameters by a finite set of moment inequalities and conduct inference. I apply the model to village networks in rural India and find that friendship affects the formation of risk sharing and other favor exchange networks in the same direction. On the other hand\, the empirical evidence for caste homophily in risk sharing and favor exchange networks is inconclusive.

DESCRIPTION:Closed‐form approximations to moment values of an AR(1) model in unit root and stationary cases.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nIt is well‐known that the ordinary least‐squares (OLS) estimator of first‐order autoregressive (AR(1)) models is biased in finite samples. Unfortunately the finite sample  distributions of such estimators remain unknown. To study its distributional properties\, the lower  order moments have been explored extensively in both analytical and computational approaches. However\,  most of such studies in the analytical approach focus on the first two moments and obtain only a few terms which are expressed in terms of the sample size and the autoregressive parameter. To the best of our knowledge\, the closed‐form expressions for mean\, variance\, skewness and kurtosis remain unknown. We revisit these classic problems and are able to obtain analytically simple but accurate closed‐form approximations to the first four moments of the OLS estimator of AR(1) model without intercept. It includes the stationary case where the autoregressive parameter is less than 1 and the unit‐root case. Accuracies of the moment values computed by the closed‐form approximations are compared with those exact values computed by numerical methods. It is found that our approximations are reasonably accurate for a wide range of sample size and autoregressive parameter\, with errors less than 0.1% in most of the cases.\n\nhttp://www.fas.nus.edu.sg/ecs/people/profile/ecsatsui.html

DESCRIPTION:Measuring the Connectedness of the Global Economy\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe introduction of the panel and global VAR frameworks and the increasing sophistication  of large simulated systems provides opportunities to analyse international linkages in unprecedented depth. However\, the considerable volume of statistical output generated by such models introduces a secondary curse of dimensionality\, whereby the limits of the modeller's ability to process the output become a binding constraint. This paper develops a family of Generalized Connectedness Measures (GCMs) which provide a simple means to summarise the linkages embodied in such models non-selectively either with recourse to geographic aggregation or aggregation into desired groups of similar variables. These GCMs are derived from generalized forecast error variance decompositions in a manner that extends the connectedness measures developed by Diebold and Yilmaz (2009\, 2013). Our GCMs preserve information across horizons and are robust both to the reordering of variables and to aggregation. We apply our approach using the 26 country 176 variable GVAR model developed by Greenwood-Nimmo\, Nguyen and Shin (2012\, Journal of Applied Econometrics) and derive vivid representations of the linkages embodied in the model. Our results indicate that the US\, the Eurozone and the crude oil market are hot-spots for the transmission of shocks in the global economy and that shocks transmitted through equity markets can strongly affect real magnitudes.\n\nhttp://www.greenwoodeconomics.com/

DESCRIPTION:On Confidence Sets for Variable Selection\n\nABSTRACT\n\nIn this talk\, I discuss the notion of variable selection confidence set (VSCS)  for linear regression based on F-testing. The VSCS extends the usual notion of confidence\nintervals to the variable selection problem: A VSCS is a set of regression models that contains the true model with a given level of confidence. For noisy data\, distinguishing among competing models is usually very difficult and the VSCS will contain many models\; if the data are really informative\, the VSCS will contain a much smaller number of useful models. I advocate special attention to the set of lower boundary models (LBMs)\, which are the most parsimonious models that are not statistically significantly inferior to the full model at a given confidence level. Based on the LBMs\, variable importance and measures of co-appearance importance of predictors can be naturally defined.  Our method identifies the most important variables in a principled way that goes beyond simply trusting the single lucky winner based on a model selection criterion.\n\nUp to date\, an almost exclusive emphasis has been on selecting a single model or two. In the presence of a number of predictors\, especially when the number of predictors is comparable to (or even larger than) the sample size\, the hope of identifying the true or the unique best  model is often unrealistic. Consequently\, a better approach is to select a relatively small set of models that all can more or less adequately explain the data at the given confidence level. This strategy identifies the most important variables in a principled way that goes beyond simply trusting the single lucky winner based on a model selection criterion.\n\nhttp://www.findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/display/person479893

DESCRIPTION:Instrument-Free Identification and Estimation of Differentiated Products Models Using Cost Data\n\nABSTRACT\n\nIn this paper\, we propose a methodology for jointly estimating the demand and cost functions of differentiated goods oligopoly models when demand and cost data are available. The method deals with the endogeneity of prices to unobserved product quality in the demand function\, as well as the endogeneity of output to unobserved cost shocks in firms' cost functions. Our method does not\, however\, require instruments to do so. We establish identification\, consistency and asymptotic normality of our estimator. Using Monte-Carlo experiments\, we demonstrate that it works well in situations where instruments are correlated with the error term in the demand and cost functions\, and where the standard IV approach results in bias.\n\nhttps://www.uts.edu.au/staff/susumu.imai

DESCRIPTION:Bivariate asymmetric GARCH models with heavy tails and dynamic conditional correlations\n\nABSTRACT\n\nA bivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic model with dynamic conditional correlation and leverage effect (DCC-GJR-GARCH) for modelling financial time series data is considered. For robustness it is helpful to assume a multivariate Student-t distribution for the innovation terms. This paper proposes a new modified multivariate t-distribution which is a robustifying distribution and offers independent marginal Student-t distributions with different degrees of freedom\, thereby highlighting the relationship among different assets. A Bayesian approach with adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo methods is used for statistical inference. A simulation experiment illustrates good performance in estimation over reasonable sample sizes. In the empirical studies\, the pair-wise relationship between the Australian stock market and foreign exchange market\, and between the US stock market and crude oil market are investigated\, including out-of-sample volatility forecasts. \n\nhttp://sydney.edu.au/business/staff/borisc

DESCRIPTION:Irrelevant Instrumental Variables\n\nABSTRACT \n\nAn instrumental variable (IV) that is uninformative about the conditional mean of the endogenous regressor is said to be irrelevant. However\, such an IV could affect the conditional distribution of the endogenous regressor\, but these effects are usually not exploited for the estimation and identification of structural equations in practice. In this research\, I explore a new regression technique\, dubbed the Asymmetric Least Squares IV Estimator (ALIVE)\, to extract the information that an IV has on the conditional distribution of the endogenous regressor\, then use this information to uncover the linear causal effect of this regressor on the outcome of interest. I present simulated evidence on the performance of ALIVE when the IV is invalid\, and show that ALIVE outperforms the IV estimator even when the IV is valid. I also compare ALIVE with two competing estimation approaches for using irrelevant IVs\, the Mean-on-Quantile and the control function approach\, that require certain priors about the data generating process not required by ALIVE. I show that even if one possesses such additional information\, the competing approaches that take advantage of it do not outperform ALIVE in simulations. \n\nhttp://www.adelaide.edu.au/directory/nicholas.sim

DESCRIPTION:Empirical Likelihood Estimation For Infinitely Many Poverty Comparisons\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe topic of this paper is constrained empirical likelihood (EL) estimation of two income distributions for data at low levels of aggregation. The constraints we consider rank the distributions according to an infinite set of poverty measures\, which is characterized in terms of a continuum of unconditional moment inequality conditions. Constrained EL in our setup is a concave semi-infinite programming (SIP) optimization problem because there is a continuum of inequality constraints\, and a finite number of choice variables. We establish the existence and uniqueness of the estimator for a general class of poverty measures\, and its characterization in terms of Lagrange multipliers using SIP methods. The proposed estimator of the distributions is shown to be uniformly convergent in probability over the statistical model. The corresponding estimator of the moments is shown to have smaller mean integrated squared error than its unrestricted counterpart\, uniformly over the statistical model. We use an exchange computational algorithm for solving SIPs to approximate the constrained EL estimator. This algorithm has two fine-tuning parameters which are (1) the number of constraints that are used\, and (2) a tolerance parameter that controls the level of the violation of the unused constraints. We give the growth rate of the number of moment inequalities for the uniform consistency of the approximation to the proposed estimator of the continuum of moments\, and we show that no specific rate of decline of the tolerance parameter is required for uniform consistency. The uniform rate of convergence of the approximate solution is given as it depends on the two fine-tuning parameters. Finally\, we report the results of Monte Carlo experiments.\n\nhttp://sydney.edu.au/arts/economics/staff/profiles/rami.tabri.php

DESCRIPTION:AdaptSpect: Estimation of Time Varying Spectrum\n\nABSTRACT\n\nIn many practical problems\, time series are realizations of nonstationary random processes.These processes can often be modeled as processes with slowly changing dynamics or as piecewise stationary processes. In these cases\, various approaches to estimating the time-varying spectral density have been proposed. Our approach in this paper is to estimate local log spectra using a Bayesian mixture of splines. The basic idea of our approach is to first partition the data into small sections. We then assume that the log spectral density of the evolutionary process in any given partition is a mixture of individual log spectra. We use a mixture of smoothing splines model to estimate the evolutionary log spectrum. The mixture model is fit using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques that yield estimates of the log spectra of the individual subsections\, as well as pointwise credible intervals for the unknown log spectrum. We use a reversible jump step to automatically determine the number of different spectral components. We illustrate the methodology by applying the approach to two real examples.\n\nhttp://www.mbs.edu/facultyresearch/facultydirectory/Pages/SallyWood.aspx

DESCRIPTION:Welfare Dependence and Self-Control: An Empirical Analysis\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThis paper investigates the behavioral and policy mechanisms that generate dependence on welfare programs. A dynamic model with labor supply disincentives and state dependence in preferences is expanded to incorporate time-inconsistency\, which induces addictive behavior due to problems of self-commitment. Estimation is based on data from a welfare reform experiment\, which contains a unique policy feature that helps identify the time preference parameters. Various results indicate that the commitment problem is an important consideration in the design of policy. Around one-fourth of the individuals are time-inconsistent\, and neglecting time-inconsistency will cause state dependence in preferences to be overestimated. These individuals are more responsive to policy changes due to the presence of commitment-related incentives. Time-inconsistency reduces income and net tax contribution by at least 15 and 50 percent\, respectively. An increase in welfare benefits aggravates the commitment problem\, and reduces utility from a time-consistent perspective. Certain dynamic policy interventions are more effective than static interventions in alleviating the commitment problem. For instance\, a dynamic nonwork tax generates strong commitment-related work incentives\, and over half of time-inconsistent individuals will voluntarily adopt it as a commitment device. The implications of time-inconsistency for other policy interventions\, such as Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and a prowork time limit\, are examined.\n\nhttp://www.finance.uts.edu.au/staff/marcc/

DESCRIPTION:"Estimating Incentive and Selection Effects in the Medigap Insurance Market: An Application with Dirichlet Process Mixture Model"\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThis paper presents an empirical study of endogenous treatment effects in the presence of heterogeneous responses. We estimate the incentive and selection effects of having prescription drug coverage on total drug expenditures using a sample from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS).\n\nA Dirichlet Process Mixture (DPM) model is used to model the heterogeneity in treatment effects. Rather than estimating a finite mixture model with a fixed number of components\, we specify a DP prior on the pa- rameters\, thus allowing the data and prior knowledge to determine the number of components. Endogeneity is modeled by the covariance of the error terms of the selection and the outcome equations in a two-equation selection model.\n\nWe find that there are strong incentive and advantageous selection effects\, with the average treatment effect and the average treatment effect for the treated estimated at $1132 and $858\, respectively. Substantial heterogeneity is found to exist in the selection effects\, particularly for those having lower drug expenditures.\n\nhttp://www.uq.edu.au/economics/trivedi-pravin

It is calculated after the estimation of a VAR model and different versions of it are estimated the VAR process is time-variant. We assume that the process of interest is locally stationary and propose the nonparametric local linear estimator of a time-varying VAR. The estimates are used to obtain a confidence band where the IRF of such process is likely to lie.\n\nhttp://www.icasasweb.com/

DESCRIPTION:Infinite Order Cross-Validated Local Polynomial Regression\n\nAbstract: \nMany practical problems require nonparametric estimates of regression functions\, and local polynomial regression has emerged as a leading approach. In applied settings practitioners often adopt either the local constant or local linear variants\, or choose the order of the local polynomial to be slightly greater than the order of the maximum derivative estimate required. But such ad hoc determination of the polynomial order may not be optimal in general\, while the joint determination of the polynomial order and bandwidth presents some interesting theoretical and practical challenges. In this paper we propose a data-driven approach towards the joint determination of the polynomial order and bandwidth\, provide theoretical underpinnings\, and demonstrate that improvements in both finite-sample efficiency and rates of convergence can thereby be obtained. In the case where the true data generating process (DGP) is in fact a polynomial whose order does not depend on the sample size\, our method is capable of attaining the √n rate often associated with correctly specified parametric models\, while the estimator is shown to be uniformly consistent for a much larger class of DGPs. Theoretical underpinnings are provided and finite-sample properties are examined.

DESCRIPTION:Title:  Monotonicity in IV and fuzzy RD designs - A Guide to Practice\n\nAbstract: \nWhenever treatment effects are heterogeneous and there is sorting into treatment based on the gain\, monotonicity is a condition that both Instrumental Variable and fuzzy Regression Discontinuity designs have to satisfy for their estimate to be interpretable as a LATE. However\, applied economic work rarely discusses this important assumption.  We provide insights in how to think about monotonicity. While there is no test of monotonicity in itself\, the joint hypotheses of independence and monotonicity lead to testable implications. Yet\, these implications are necessary but not sufficient for independence and monotonicity to hold. Therefore\, we argue that monotonicity can and should be investigated using a mix of economic intuition and data patterns\, just like other untestable assumptions in an IV or fuzzy RD design. We provide examples in a variety of settings as a guide to practice. We also discuss recent theoretical work that either develops alternative tests or attempts to replace monotonicity with weaker assumptions.

DESCRIPTION:Title: OLS and IV estimation of regression models including endogenous interaction terms\n\nAbstract: \n\nWe analyze a class of linear regression models including interactions of endogenous regressors and exogenous covariates. We show that\, under typical conditions regarding higher-order dependencies between endogenous and exogenous regressors\, the OLS estimator of the coefficient of the interaction term is consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. Applying heteroskedasticity-consistent covariance matrix estimators\, we then show that standard inference based on OLS is valid for the coefficient of the interaction term. Furthermore\, we analyze several IV estimators\, and show that an implementation assuming exogeneity of the interaction term is valid under fairly weak conditions. In the more general case\, we derive that instruments need to be interacted with the exogenous part of the interaction to achieve identification. Finally\, we propose several specification tests to empirically assess the validity of OLS and IV inference for the interaction model. Using our theoretical results we confirm recent empirical findings on the nonlinear causal relation between financial development and economic growth.

DESCRIPTION:Title: The Trickle-Down Effect of Mining Boom in Australia - A Fact or Myth?\n\nAbstract: The mining sector in Australia has been flourishing in recent years. There is a general perception that the benefits of the mining boom flow to other non-mining production and services sectors. This paper examines the relationship between the mining sector and various non-mining sectors in an attempt to unfold the role of mining sector in Australia. In particular\, the unobserved components model has been used to estimate the effects of output gap in mining sector on that of each of several non-mining sectors. In general\, the results of the estimates do not suggest significant positive effect running from the mining sector to other sectors\, implying that the trickle-down effect of the mining boom is probably a myth.

DESCRIPTION:<b>Not Drowning\, Waving</b>\n\n<b>Abstract: </b>\nIn this technological age we are drowning in data. Good data visualisation helps us to swim\, digest the data\, and learn about our world. The statistics community creates visualisation systems within the context of data analysis\, so the graphics are designed to support and enrich the statistical processes of data exploration\, modeling\, and inference. As a result\, statistical data visualisation has some unique features which differentiates it from visualisations made in other fields. Statisticians are always concerned with variability in observations and error in measurements\, both of which cause uncertainty about conclusions drawn from data. Dealing with this uncertainty is at the heart of classical statistics\, and statisticians have developed a huge body of inferential methods that help to quantify uncertainty. Statistical data graphics cover a spectrum of methods including elegant static data visualisations and highly interactive and dynamic graphics used for exploratory data analysis.\n\nIn this talk\, we will explain how graphical methods were used to study the tech boom and bust of the late 1990s\, food quality control\,  atmospheric CO2 levels and temperature changes\, stimulus fund spending\, university ranking\, PISA education data\, labor market wages\, stock market trends\, and soybean breeding for agribusiness. (Ok\, only a selection of these will be used.) We will explain how interactive statistical graphics systems are constructed that enable data exploration\, how this differs from computer graphics\, and how incorporating inferential techniques enables us to determine if what we see is real. We will also describe new developments that allow (almost) everyone to become developers. Good data visualisation equips statisticians to balance skepticism with discovery\, and helps business analysts swim with their data.

DESCRIPTION:<b>Increasing Trends in the Excess Comovement of Commodity Prices</b>\n\n<b>Abstract:</b>\nWe investigate whether and how excess comovement of commodity returns has changed over the period 1983-2011. Using the STDCC model\, we find that significant increasing long-run trends in excess comovement have appeared since around 2000. We confirm that these increasing trends are not caused just by the recent financial crisis or the changes in sensitivities to common macroeconomic shocks. Moreover\, we find no significant increasing trends among off-index commodity returns and small effects of global demand on increasing trends in excess comovement. These findings provide additional evidence for the timing and scope of the recent increasing commodity-return correlations.

DESCRIPTION:Title: A Benchmark Approach to Finance\n\nAbstract: This lecture introduces into the benchmark approach\, which provides a generalized framework for financial market modelling. It allows for a unified treatment of derivative pricing\, portfolio optimization and risk management. It extends beyond the classical asset pricing theories\, with significant differences emerging for extreme maturity contracts and risk measures relevant to pensions and insurance. The Law of the Minimal Price will be presented for derivative pricing. A Naïve Diversification Theorem allows forming a proxy for the numeraire portfolio. The richer modelling framework of the benchmark approach leads to the derivation of tractable\, realistic models under the real world probability measure. It will be explained how the approach differs from the classical risk neutral approach. Examples on long term and extreme maturity derivatives demonstrate the important fact that a range of contracts can be less expensively priced and hedged than suggested by classical theory.

DESCRIPTION:<b> Adverse Selection\, Moral Hazard and the Demand for Medigap Insurance </b>\n\n<b>Abstract:</b>\nThe size of adverse selection and moral hazard effects in health insurance markets has important policy implications. For example\, if adverse selection effects are small while moral hazard effects are large\, conventional remedies for inefficiencies created by adverse selection (e.g.\, mandatory insurance enrolment) may lead to substantial increases in health care spending. Unfortunately\, there is no consensus on the magnitudes of adverse selection vs. moral hazard. This paper sheds new light on this important topic by studying the US Medigap (supplemental) health insurance market. While both adverse selection and moral hazard effects of Medigap have been studied separately\, this is the first paper to estimate both in a unified econometric framework.Our results suggest there is adverse selection into Medigap\, but the effect is small. A one standard deviation increase in expenditure risk raises the probability of insurance  purchase by 0.055. In contrast\, our estimate of the moral hazard effect is much larger. On average\, Medigap coverage increases health care expenditure by 24%.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Neither Public not Private: The Effects of Communal Water Provision on Child Health in Peru\n\nAbstract: The literature on water provision has typically compared the effects of private and mixed public-private systems versus public provision\, but has completely ignored alternative systems such as communal organizations\, which are especially prevalent in developing countries. Using detailed survey data at the household level for the years 2006-2010\, we investigate the effects of communal water provision on child health in Peru. As the municipalities served by communal organizations are more likely to have poorer health indicators\, we rely on an instrumental variable strategy to deal with the potential endogeneity problem. Specifically\, we use the administrative urban/rural classification of the smaller population units in which municipalities are divided in Peru. We present direct and indirect evidence that this is a valid instrument. Our results show a negative and significant effect of communal water provision on diarrhoea and acute malnutrition among children under the age of five. These findings are robust to a number of checks and placebo tests. We also find that communal provision is not associated with higher rates of access to piped water. Rather\, the channel through which communal water system benefits child health seems to be better management and service quality.

DESCRIPTION:<b> Measuring the Compositional Bias in Earnings Growth Over a Cyclical Upwsing </b>\n\n<b> Abstract </b>\n\nWe use Linked Employer-Employee Database (LEED) data from New Zealand to investigate the impact of changes in the composition of workers and firms on measured average real full-time equivalent (FTE) earnings growth over the cyclical upswing between 1999 and 2007. During this period\, employment increased by over 20 percent and measured average FTE earnings increased by 9 percent (1.3 percent annually). In contrast\, we estimate that composition-adjusted average FTE earnings grew 15 percent. The changing composition of workers accounts for 5 percentage points of the difference: 60 percent from the entry of lower-paid workers\, and 25 and 15 percent respectively from lower-paid continuing and intermittently-employed workers working more. The remaining 1 percentage point difference is associated with the changing composition of firms: this was largely due to new firms having lower earnings premiums\, but is offset to a small degree by an increase in employment by existing firms.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Financial Bubble Implosion\n\nAbstract: Expansion and collapse are two key features of a financial asset bubble. Bubble expansion may be modeled using a mildly explosive process. Bubble implosion may take several different forms depending on the nature of the collapse and therefore requires some flexibility in modeling. This paper develops analytics and studies the performance characteristics of the real time bubble monitoring strategy proposed in Phillips\, Shi and Yu (2014b\,c\, PSY) under alternative forms of bubble implosion that can be represented in terms of mildly integrated processes which capture various return paths to market normalcy. We propose a new reverse sample use of the PSY procedure for detecting crises and estimating the date of market recovery. Consistency of the dating estimators is established and the limit theory addresses new complications arising from the alternative forms of bubble implosion and the endogeneity effects present in the reverse regression. Simulations explore the finite sample performance of the strategy for dating maket recovery and an illustration to the Nasdaq stock market is provided. A real-time version of the strategy is provided that is suited for practical implementation.

DESCRIPTION:<b>Title: </b> Bayesian model averaging and principal component regression forecasts in a data rich environment\n \n<b>Abstract:</b> This paper studies the `real-time' out-of-sample forecast performance of Bayesian moving averaging (BMA) and principal component regression (PCR) applied to many predictors. The paper conducts a different out-of-sample investigation in which the forecasts are constructed jointly for U.S. inflation and output allowing the forecast errors to be correlated. The posterior distribution of models and parameters are re-estimated\, and the 12-months-ahead forecasts are computed for each month using a 10-years rolling window. This time-varying reduced form offers flexibility in capturing structural changes and instabilities of unknown forms. While the competing forecasts are highly correlated\, PCR performed marginally better than BMA in terms of mean-squared forecast error. Both PCR and BMA fail to improve over the random walk model during the great moderation. However\, analysis of the local relative performance indicates that PCR may outperform BMA with statistically significant margins. Further\, PCR forecasts match the first and second moments of the target series with minimal biases\, while BMA forecasts fail to match the volatility of the series\, especially inflation. Orthogonalizing the predictors may bring computational gains but at a great loss of performance.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Modelling cross correlation across major financial markets: a threshold approach\n\nAbstract: In this paper we propose a parsimonious regime-switching approach to model the correlations between assets\, the threshold conditional correlation (TCC) model. This method allows the dynamics of the correlations to change from one state (or regime) to another as a function of observable transition variables. Our model is similar in spirit to Silvennoinen and Teräsvirta (2009) but with the appealing feature that is easier to estimate\, particularly in large cross-sections. Estimation of the parameters of the TCC involves a grid search maximum likelihood (ML) procedure in which the correlation matrix is positive definite by construction. The methodology is illustrated by evaluating the behaviour of international equities\, government bonds and major exchange rates\, first separately and then jointly. We also test and allow for different parts in the correlation matrix to be governed by different transition variables. For this\, we estimate a multi-threshold TCC specification. Further\, we evaluate the out-of-sample economic performance of the TCC model against the dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) using the Engle-Colacito (2006) test. The results show that threshold model generally gives rise to a significant reduction in portfolio´s variance compared to the DCC\, expect for when correlations are highly persistent.

Earlier work has investigated the difficulties in estimating a quantile regression model in the case of binary selection rule. This paper shows how these difficulties are overcome when the selection rule is censored rather than binary. This\, in the mean regression case\, corresponds to the Tobit type 3 model. We provide a two step estimator for this model in which a first step is estimated by distribution regression and is used to produce a control function. We then show how the control function can be used in a second step to allow quantile regression methods to be employed while accounting for selection bias.

Miller) forthcoming in <i> Journal of Human Resources</i>\,Spring 2015. \n\n<b> Abstract: </b>\nWe consider statistical inference for regression when data are grouped into clusters\, with regression model errors independent across clusters but correlated within clusters. Examples include data on individuals with clustering on village or region or other category such as industry\, and state-year differences-in-differences studies with clustering on state. In such settings default standard errors can greatly overstate estimator precision. Instead\, if the number of clusters is large\, statistical inference after OLS should be based on cluster-robust standard errors. We outline the basic method as well as many complications that can arise in practice.  These include cluster-specific fixed effects\, few clusters\, multi-way clustering\, and estimators other than OLS.\n\nThe paper is available to download from the following url: \nhttp://cameron.econ.ucdavis.edu/research/Cameron_Miller_JHR_2014_July_09.pdf

DESCRIPTION:Title: Algorithmic Trading\, Market Timing\, and Market Efficiency\n\n\nAbstract: In recent years large panel data models have been developed to make full use of the Information content of such datasets. Despite the large number of contributions\, an important issue that is rarely pursued in much of the existing literature concerns the risk of neglecting structural beaks in the data generating process.  While a substantial literature on structural break analysis exists for univariate time series\, a relatively small number of techniques have been developed for panel data models.  This paper provides a new treatment to deal with the problem of multiple structural breaks that occur at unknown date points in the panel model parameters.  Our method is related to the Haar wavelet technique that we adjust according to the structure of the explanatory variables in order to detect the change points of the parameters consistently.  We apply the technique to high frequency  securities data to examine the effects of algorithmic trading (AT) on standard measures of market quality that proxy for some dimension of liquidity.  Specifically\, we examine whether AT has time varying effects on liquidity and discuss asset pricing implications.

DESCRIPTION:Title: A New Nonparametric Specification Test for the Drift of the Short-Term Interest Rate Process\n\nAbstract:\nThe drift of the short term interest rate process has a crucial role both in capturing the time-series behavior and in pricing the cross section of interest rate claims. This has drawn attention to the shape of the drift. Empirical evidence from model specification test in Ait-sahalia (1996) suggests that the drift function of the short rate process is nonlinear. The findings of a nonlinear drift have\, however been challenged by Chapman and Pearson (2000). The Monte Carlo simulations show that the nonparametric drift function estimator proposed by Stanton (1997) can produce spurious nonlinearities even when the drift function is truly linear. This motivates Sam and Jiang (2009) to propose a new nonparametric estimator of the drift function in the short rate process. The proposed estimator can greatly reduce the finite sample bias of the nonparametric estimator of the drift function proposed by Stanton (1997). \n\nBased on the new nonparametric estimator of the drift function proposed by Sam and Jiang (2009)\, we propose a new consistent test for the parametric specificaion of the drift funcion in a short term interest rate process using observations from a panel of yields. The data are assumed to be sampled discretely in a time interval that can be fixed or lengthened to infinity. The test statistic is shown to follow an asymptotic normal distribution under the null hypothesis that the parametric diffusion function is correctly specified.

Using various panel estimators\, we find rice yields significantly explain weight gain in young children\, but not linear growth. We further show that rice yields have large and positive effects on the timely introduction of complementary foods for young children\, but not on dietary diversity indicators\, and that this complementary feeding indicator is positively associated with child weight gain but not with linear growth. The reverse holds for dietary diversity indicators. The results therefore suggest that Bangladesh’s Green Revolution has made a large contribution to improvements in weight gain\, but had little effect on postnatal linear growth. Achieving the latter would appear to require greater efforts to diversify diets out of cereals and into more micronutrient-rich foods.

DESCRIPTION:Title:\n\nSimultaneous equation models with discrete outcomes: Coherence and completeness using panel data.\n\nAbstract: \n\nExtending the simultaneous equations approach to jointly determined discrete outcomes has proved to be challenging. One has to impose the so-called coherency condition to guarantee the existence of a unique reduced form. These conditions effectively convert a model where the endogenous variables are jointly determined into a model that is triangular or recursive. In the spirit of a suggestion by Lewbel (2007)\, I propose using panel data to decide how the coherency condition will hold without restricting error supports or imposing triangularity. Furthermore\, incidental parameter biases are avoided and time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity can now be thought of as an indicator of the direction of causality between the discrete outcomes. Finally\, I apply the proposal and revisit the model of employment conditions and borrowing constraints estimated by Hajivassiliou and Ioannides. (2007).

DESCRIPTION:Title:\n\nStructural Vector Autoregressions with Smooth Transition in Variances: The Interaction Between U.S. Monetary Policy and the Stock Market\n\nAbstract:\n\nIn structural vector autoregressive analysis identifying the shocks of interest via heteroskedasticity has become a standard tool. Unfortunately\, the approaches currently used for modelling heteroskedasticity all have drawbacks. For instance\, assuming known dates for variance changes is often unrealistic while more flexible models based on GARCH or Markov switching residuals are difficult to handle from a statistical and computational point of view. Therefore we propose a model based on a smooth change in variance that is flexible as well as relatively easy to estimate. The model is applied to a five-dimensional system of U.S. variables to explore the interaction between monetary policy and the stock market. It is found that previously used conventional identification schemes in this context are rejected by the data if heteroskedasticity is allowed for. Shocks identified via heteroskedasticity have a different economic interpretation than the shocks identified using conventional methods.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Additional Conditional Moment Tests\n\nAbstract: The primary focus of this article is the provision of tests for additional conditional moment constraints in cross-section or short panel data contexts. The principal contribution is the explicit incorporation of conditional moment restrictions defining the maintained hypothesis in the formulation of the test statistics thus mirroring that of the classical parametric likelihood setting by defining restricted tests in contradistinction to unrestricted tests that partially or completely ignore the maintained moment condition information. The framework is quite general allowing the parameters defining the additional and maintained conditional moment restrictions to differ and permitting the conditioning variates to differ likewise. GMM and generalized empirical likelihood test statistics are suggested. The asymptotic properties of the statistics are described under both null hypothesis and a suitable sequence of local alternatives. An extensive set of simulation experiments explores the practical efficacy of the various test statistics in terms of empirical size and size-adjusted power confirming the superiority of restricted over unrestricted tests. A number of restricted tests possess both sufficiently satisfactory empirical size and power characteristics to allow their recommendation for econometric practice.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Extended MaxT Tests of One-Sided Hypotheses\n\nAbstract: In many statistical applications of one-sided tests of multiple hypotheses researchers are often concerned not only with global tests of the intersection of individual hypotheses\, but also with multiple tests of individual hypotheses. For example\, in clinical trial studies researchers often need to nd out the ecacy of a treatment\, as well as the significance of each outcome measurement (endpoint) of the treatment. This paper proposes MaxT type tests aiming at improving the global power of existing MaxT tests. Our extended MaxT tests are constructed by adding an extra component to the maximand set of existing MaxT tests. The added component is a weighted sum of other components. Some power properties relating to choices of weight are studied. Our simulation study shows that the proposed tests can considerably improve the global power of existing MaxT tests and can also outperform many other global tests under some alternatives and/or some non-normal distributions. Furthermore\, it is shown that such global power improvement may involve little loss of power on multiple testing. Two real data examples in clinical trial studies reported in the literature are re-examined. The results of our tests suggest stronger evidence on treatment effects over MaxT tests and likelihood ratio tests while changing little on the evidence concerning endpoint testing.

DESCRIPTION:In this paper we aim to contribute to the literature on econometric methods for large datasets. We introduce a Bayesian procedure for time-varying combinations of large sets of predictive densities that can deal with many data. The approach is based on clustering the set of predictive densities in mutually exclusive subsets and on a hierarchical specification of the combination weights. This modeling strategy reduces the  dimension of the latent space and leads to parsimonious combinations. For efficient updating of the dynamic weights of the density combination use is made of parallel sequential Monte Carlo filters. We apply our proposed procedure to a large set of predictive densities using macroeconomic data and find substantial gains in point and density forecasting of US real GDP\, GDP deflator inflation\, Treasury Bill returns and employment over the last 25 years for all horizons from 1-quarter ahead to 5-quarter head. The highest accuracy is achieved when the four series are predicted simultaneously using our combination schemes with within and across cluster weights based on log score learning. Furthermore\, we found that weights within clusters are very volatile\, indicating that individual model performances are very unstable\, strengthening the use of  density combinations. Finally\, we show that the GPU algorithm can reduce the computing time with respect to CPU version of several multiples of CPU time.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Selecting (In)Valid Instruments for Instrumental Variables Estimation\n\nAbstract: A common estimation procedure for identifying the magnitude of causal effects is that of instrumental variables\, where instruments are associated with modifiable risk factors\, but do not have a direct effect on the outcome and are not associated with unobserved confounders. For example\, in epidemiology\, the principle of Mendelian randomisation has led to the use of genes as instruments for modifiable risk factors like weight. An issue with genes is that it is not always known whether the exclusion restriction holds\, i.e. whether they could also have a direct effect on the outcome. Recent developments in statistics have focused on selection methods for (in)valid instruments\, like Lasso type methods. We show that these methods can select the correct instruments when more than 50% of the instruments are valid\, but that weights need to be used for when instrument strengths vary. We also show that conditions for LARS are stricter than that for simple Forward Selection methods.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Jump Detection in Generalized Error-in-variables Regression with an Application to Australian Health Tax Policies\n\nAbstract: Without measurement errors in predictors\, discontinuity of a non-parametric regression function at unknown locations could be estimated using a number of existing approaches. However\, it becomes a challenging problem when the predictors contain measurement errors. In this paper\, an error-in-variables jump point estimator is suggested for a nonparametric generalized error-in-variables regression model. A major feature of our method is that it does not impose any parametric distribution on the measurement error. Its performance is evaluated by both numerical studies and theoretical justifications. The method is applied to studying the impact of Medicare Levy Surcharge on the private health insurance take-up rate in Australia.

DESCRIPTION:Title:  Double Instrumental Variable Estimation of Interaction Models with Big Data\n\nAbstract: The static factor analysis of a (n\,m) matrix of observations Y is usually based on the joint spectral decomposition of the matrix squares YY' and Y'Y. However\, for very large dimensions m and n\, this approach has a high level of numerical complexity. Indeed\, the number of required computations grows cubically w.r.t. the matrix dimensions\, that is\, faster than the number of observations. The big data dimensions can be used to propose new estimation methods with a reasonable numerical complexity. The double instrumental variable (IV) approach uses row instruments and column instruments to estimate consistently the factors up to K^2 parameters\, where K is the number of factors. Then\, the factor model can be concentrated and the K^2 missing parameters estimated consistently by ordinary least squares. The double IV approach can be used for the analysis of recommender systems and is a new collaborative filtering approach.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Markov Interacting Importance Samplers\n\nAbstract: We introduce a new Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler called the Markov Interacting Importance Sampler (MIIS). The MIIS sampler uses conditional importance sampling (IS) approximations to jointly sample the current state of the Markov Chain and estimate conditional expectations\, possibly by incorporating a full range of variance reduction techniques.  We compute Rao-Blackwellized estimates based on the conditional expectations to construct control variates for estimating expectations under the target distribution. The control variates are particularly efficient when there are substantial correlations between the variables in the target distribution\, a challenging setting for MCMC. An important motivating application of MIIS occurs when the exact Gibbs sampler is not available because it is infeasible to directly simulate from the conditional distributions. In this case the MIIS method  can be much more efficient than a Metropolis-within-Gibbs approach. We also introduce the MIIS random walk algorithm\, designed to accelerate convergence and improve upon the computational efficiency of standard random walk samplers. Simulated and empirical illustrations for Bayesian analysis show that the method significantly reduces the variance of  Monte Carlo estimates compared to standard MCMC approaches\, at equivalent implementation and computational effort.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Efficient estimation in semivarying coefficient models for longitudinal/clustered data\n\nAbstract: In semivarying coefficient modeling of longitudinal/clustered data\, usually of primary interest is the parametric component which involves unknown constant coefficients.\nWe first study semiparametric efficiency bound for estimation of the constant coefficients in a general setup. It can be achieved by spline regression provided that the within-cluster covariance matrices are known\, which is an unrealistic assumption. Thus\, we propose an estimator of the constant coefficients when the covariance matrices are unknown and depend only on the index variable and under the identity link function. After preliminary estimation based on working independence\, we estimate the covariance matrices by applying local linear regression to the resultant residuals. Using the covariance matrix estimates\, we employ spline regression to obtain our final estimator of  the constant coefficients. The proposed estimator achieves the semiparametric efficiency bound under normality assumption\, and it has the smallest asymptotic covariance matrix among a class of estimators even when normality is violated. Finite sample performance of our estimator is examined and compared with the working independence estimator and some existing method via simulations and a real data example.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Bayesian Semiparametric Modeling of Realized Covariance Matrices\n\nAbstract:  This paper introduces several new Bayesian nonparametric models suitable for capturing the unknown conditional distribution of realized covariance (RCOV) matrices.  Existing dynamic Wishart models are extended to countably innite mixture models of Wishart and inverse-Wishart distributions. In addition to mixture models with constant weights we propose models with time-varying weights to capture time dependence in the unknown distribution. Each of our models can be combined with returns to provide a coherent joint model of returns and RCOV. The extensive forecast results show the new models provide very signicant improvements in density forecasts for RCOV and returns and competitive point forecasts of RCOV.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Mitigating model uncertainty using trace optimisation: An application to exponential smoothing\n\nAbstract: \nExponential smoothing is a reference method within the forecasting discipline\, due to its simplicity\, relatively good forecasting accuracy and ease of automation. The literature has continuously improved upon many of its initial limitations. However\, novel applications have brought new forecasting challenges where exponential smoothing methods have provided contradictory findings\, revealing pitfalls in its use. In this work we examine potential reasons for these inconsistencies and argue that special attention should be drawn to the cost function used to fit the model. Conventional cost functions assume that the postulated model is true\, which is hardly case for many applications. We propose the use of alternative cost functions based on multi-step ahead predictions and trace forecasts and demonstrate substantial benefits in terms of accuracy\, a connection with shrinkage estimators\, and direct implications for practice for solar irradiation forecasting and other forecasting applications.

We find that bank loan portfolios are skewed towards firms exporting to a given destination. This skewness predicts the flow of new loans in specifications that saturate all bank-time and firm-time variation: firms that expand exports to a country increase debt disproportionately\, and are more likely to establish a new relationship\, with banks that specialize in that country. We show that bank credit supply shocks have a larger effect on exports towards the markets of specialization.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Financial consequences of seasonal change on mortality\n\nAbstract: Changes in mortality rates have a significant impact on financial and pension planning. The pricing of financial\, pension and insurance products that are contingent upon survival or death is based on the accurate forecasting of mortality rates. Knowledge of future mortality change is therefore very important from a financial point of view as a significant proportion of the financial markets are driven by pension funds. Seasonal mortality is seen each year around the world\, with a higher number of deaths in winter months compared to the summer. For example\, in the United Kingdom\, it is well known that government actions\, such as winter fuel allowances\, are designed to deal with this issue. Thus\, a fundamental question in the study of mortality rates and seasonality is how the changes in seasonality impact on mortality rates across the United Kingdom. In our research\, we implement a new factor related to temperature and show this produces a better fitting and forecasting model. We also show how changes in our environment could impact on future mortality rates and\, as a consequence\, the prices of mortality linked insurance and financial products.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Real Sectoral Spillovers: A Dynamic Factor Analysis of the Great Recession\n\nAbstract: This paper studies the transmission of aggregate and sector-specific shocks across U.S. non-farm business sectors using dynamic factor methods. By distinguishing the Great Recession from the rest of the sample period\, our method identifies the financial sector as the epicenter during the crisis. Moreover\, different from the earlier literature that relies on input-output linkages to propagate shocks\, this study allows spillovers of shocks to operate through other mechanisms. We find that aggregate fluctuations come in large part from sector-specific shocks in normal times\, while during the crisis the emerging common factor accounts for more than half of aggregate volatility.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Using information about technologies\, markets and firm behaviour to decompose a proper productivity index\n\nAbstract: This paper uses distance functions to define new output and input quantity indexes that satisfy important axioms from index number theory (e.g.\, identity\, transitivity\, proportionality and time-space reversal). Dividing the output index by the input index yields a new productivity index that can be decomposed into a measure of technical change\, a measure of environmental change\, and several measures of efficiency change. A problem with this new index is that it cannot be computed without estimating the production frontier. The paper shows how assumptions concerning technologies\, markets and firm behaviour can be used to inform the estimation process. The focus is on the asymptotic properties of least squares estimators when the explanatory variables in the production frontier model are endogenous. In this case\, the ordinary least squares estimator is usually inconsistent. However\, there is one situation where it is super-consistent. A fully-modified ordinary least squares estimator is also available in this case. To illustrate the main ideas\, the paper uses national accounts data from 30 countries to estimate a stochastic production frontier. The parameter estimates are then used to obtain estimates of the economically- relevant components of productivity change.

DESCRIPTION:Title: The Large-Sample Distribution of the Sharpe Ratio\n\nAbstract: Given a $d$--vector $\\mu$ of expected asset (excess) returns and an associated covariance matrix $\\Sigma$\, the value of a portfolio  specified by $d$-vector $x$ is obtained as a linear combination of $\\mu$ with $x$\,  and the Sharpe ratio for the portfolio is $x^T\\mu/\\sqrt{x^T \\Sigma x}$. In the Markowitz paradigm\, the portfolio having maximum Sharpe ratio is optimal.\n\nI will review results obtained over the last 10 years or so concerning the large sample distribution of a sample version of the maximum Sharpe ratio\,  assuming sample returns and covariance matrix are asymptotically normally distributed\, and considering both situations\, when short sales are allowed or not. Some notable differences occur between these cases and also according to whether the population mean return vector is 0 or not. In general\, the estimated maximum Sharpe ratio is not asymptotically normally distributed though in many cases it is.\n\nThe results permit rigorous comparisons between allocations with short sales allowed or not\, giving a means of quantifying how much may be lost in investment decisions by disallowing short sales. The theory will be illustrated on some real and some simulated data.

DESCRIPTION:Title: A study into the determinants of sales and price at auction for three Australian Indigenous artists\n\nAbstract: Albert Namatjira (1902 – 1959)\, Emily Kame Kngwarreye (c1910 – 1996) and  Rover (Julama) Thomas (1926 - 1998) are three of Australia’s best-known indigenous artists. Although they all produced a range of art works they are each primarily known for one type of paining – Namatjira for watercolour on paper\, Kngwarreye for acrylic (synthetic polymer) on canvas and Thomas for natural earth pigments on canvas. In this paper we use data from The Australian Art Sales Digest to study the determinants of sales and the hammer price of art works offered at auction for these artists. Our sample covers the periods 1969 to 2014 for Albert Namatjira\; 1993 to 2014 for Emily Kngwarreye and for Rover (Julama) Thomas.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Identifying Periods of Financial Stress in Asian Currencies: The Role of High Frequency Financial Market Data\n\nAbstract: We formally test that a process containing Brownian motion and jumps characterizes the high frequency observations for eight Asian currencies against the US dollar. By harnessing the changes in behavior of the data during periods of stress we explore evidence for detecting stress dates in the data. We align the identified stress dates to economic and political conditions using central bank and IMF reports on developments in currency markets. While there is some evidence that liquidity is related to financial stress\, increased liquidity does not often dramatically increase the probability of a stressful episode.

Visual inference allows us to find an answer to these questions similar to classical statistical hypothesis testing. Visual inference is based on non-parametric inferential methods using human observers to establish the relevance of graphical findings\, thereby creating a bridge between classical statistical inference and exploratory data analysis. Based on the seminal paper by Buja et al (2009)\, I will start with the lineup protocol\, give examples where visual inference has allowed us to gain insight beyond classical modeling situations\, and go into a discussion of some of the still open questions on visual inference.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Estimation of Large Dimensional Factor Models with an Unknown Number of Breaks\n\nAbstract: We study estimation of a large dimensional factor model when the factor loadings exhibit an unknown number of changes over time. In this talk\, I will introduce a novel three-step procedure to detect the breaks if any and then identify their locations. In the first step\, we divide the whole time span into subintervals and fit a conventional factor model on each interval. In the second step\, we apply the adaptive fused group Lasso to identify intervals containing a break. In the third step\, we devise a grid search method to estimate the location of the break on each identified interval. We show that with probability approaching one our method can identify the correct number of changes and estimate the break locations. Simulation studies indicate superb finite sample performance of our method. We apply our method to investigate Stock and Watson’s (2009) U.S. monthly macroeconomic data set.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Mixed Graphical Models with Applications to Integrative Cancer Genomics\n\nAbstract: "Mixed Data'' comprising a large number of heterogeneous variables (e.g. count\, binary\, continuous\, skewed continuous\, among others) is prevalent in varied areas such as imaging genetics\, national security\, social networking\, Internet advertising\, and our particular motivation - high-throughput integrative genomics. There have been limited efforts at statistically modeling such mixed data jointly. In this talk\, we address this by introducing several new classes of Markov Random Fields (MRFs)\, or graphical models\, that yield joint densities which directly parameterize dependencies over mixed variables. To begin\, we present a novel class of MRFs arising when all node-conditional distributions follow univariate exponential family distributions that\, for instance\, yield novel Poisson graphical models. Next\, we present several new classes of Mixed MRF distributions built by assuming each node-conditional distribution follows a potentially different exponential family distribution. Fitting these models and using them to select the mixed graph in high-dimensional settings can be achieved via penalized conditional likelihood estimation that comes with strong statistical guarantees. Simulations as well as an application to integrative cancer genomics demonstrate the versatility of our methods.

DESCRIPTION:Forecasting corporate bond returns with a large set of predictors: A regressed combination approach\n\nAbstract: Using a comprehensive data set and an array of 27 macroeconomic\, stock and bond predictors\, we find that corporate bond returns are highly predictable based on a new regressed combination model. The large set of predictors outperforms the traditional predictors substantially\, and their predictability is both statistically and economically significant. Both stock market and macroeconomic variables play an important role in forming expected bond returns. Return forecasts are closely linked to the evolution of real economy. Corporate bond premia have strong predictive power for business cycle and the primary source of this predictive power is from the low-grade bond premium.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Politics\, the Judiciary\, and the Arbitration of Unfair Dismissal Disputes\n\nAbstract: The paper analyses how the social values of government affect the outcomes of dismissal dispute arbitration in Australian labour courts. We isolate two channels through which these effects materialise: statutory reforms\, which change legal standards\, and strategic appointments\, which change court composition. We analyse the probability of plaintiff success in courts using a panel of 81 judges and 2\,223 judicial decisions between 2001 and 2015. We test for and subsequently exploit the randomized matching of labour court judges with unfair dismissal cases. We also test for and address the Priest-Klein selection effect\, which is known to potentially invalidate the analysis of court trials. We find significant effects from both channels: judges’ ideological background and changes to legal standards are strong predictors of case outcomes. Furthermore\, we find evidence of compensating effects: judges with a progressive background rule more often in favour of dismissed employees if legal reforms adversely affect their chance of success in court.

DESCRIPTION:Bootstrap Methods for Inference with Cluster-Sample IV Models.\n\nAbstract:  Microeconomic data often have within-cluster dependence. This  dependence affects standard error estimation and inference in the instrumental variables model. When the number of clusters is small\, Wald and weak-instrument tests can be severely oversized. We examine the use of bootstrap methods and find that variants of the wild bootstrap perform well and reduce absolute size bias significantly\, independent of instrument strength or cluster size. We also provide guidance in the choice among weak-instrument tests when data have cluster dependence. Two empirical examples illustrate the application of our wild bootstrap methods.

DESCRIPTION:Title:  Bias-corrected Common Correlated Effects Pooled estimation in homogeneous dynamic panels\n\nAbstract: \nThis paper extends the Common Correlated Effects Pooled (CCEP) estimator designed by Pesaran (2006) to dynamic homogeneous models. For static panels\, this estimator is consistent as the number of cross-sections (N) goes to infinity irrespectively of the time series dimension (T). However\, it suffers from a large bias in dynamic models when T is fixed (Everaert and De Groote\, 2016). We develop a bias-corrected CCEP estimator based on an asymptotic bias expression that is valid for a multi-factor error structure provided that a sufficient number of cross-sectional averages\, and lags thereof\, are added to the model. We show that the resulting CCEPbc estimator is consistent as N tends to infinity\, both for T fixed or T growing large\, and derive its limiting distribution. Monte Carlo experiments show that our bias correction performs very well. It is nearly unbiased\, even when T and/or N are small\, and hence offers a strong improvement over the severely biased CCEP estimator. CCEPbc is also found to be superior to alternative bias correction methods available in the literature in terms of bias\, variance and inference.

DESCRIPTION:A brown bag lunch seminar\n\n“A multiple testing approach to the regularisation of large sample correlation matrices”\nwhich is joint work with M. Hashem Pesaran (University of Southern California and Trinity College\, Cambridge) and L. Vanessa Smith (University of York).\n \nAbstract:\nThis paper proposes a regularisation method for the estimation of large covariance matrices that uses insights from the multiple testing (MT) literature. The approach tests the statistical significance of individual pair-wise correlations and sets to zero those elements that are not statistically significant\, taking account of the multiple testing nature of the problem. By using the inverse of the normal distribution at a predetermined significance level\, it circumvents the challenge of estimating the theoretical constant arising in the rate of convergence of existing thresholding estimators\, and hence it is easy to implement and does not require cross-validation. The MT estimator of the sample correlation matrix is shown to be consistent in the spectral and Frobenius norms\, and in terms of support recovery\, so long as the true covariance matrix is sparse. The performance of the proposed MT estimator is compared to a number of other estimators in the literature using Monte Carlo experiments. It is shown that the MT estimator performs well and tends to outperform the other estimators\, particularly when the cross section dimension\, N\, is larger than the time series dimension\, T.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Does the Future Have an Ancient Heart? Evidence on the Origins of Savings\n\nAbstract: This study investigates the channels of historical persistence in savings. A simple theoretical model predicts that savings persists indirectly through risk and time preferences\, and directly through formal financial institutions. Using a spatial regression discontinuity\, I test the theoretical predictions with experimental and survey data collected across the Habsburg-Ottoman imperial border in present-day Romania. The results confirm persistence in savings\, with higher savings in former Habsburg regions. Savings legacies do not transmit through preferences\, but rather through differential financial access. Alternative mechanisms\, such as cultural savings norms or trust in financial institutions\, are ruled out\, while falsification tests reject pseudo effects. Evidence indicates that savings mitigates household economic shocks\, suggesting important contemporaneous consequences of savings legacies.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Testing hypotheses as a mixture estimation problem\n\nAbstract: We consider a novel paradigm for Bayesian testing of hypotheses and Bayesian model comparison. Our alternative to the traditional construction of posterior probabilities that a given hypothesis is true or that the data originates from a specific model is to consider the models under comparison as components of a mixture model. We therefore replace the original testing problem with an estimation one that focus on the probability weight of a given model within a mixture model. We analyse the sensitivity on the resulting posterior distribution on the weights of various prior modelling on the weights. We stress that a major appeal in using this novel perspective is that generic improper priors are acceptable\, while not putting convergence in jeopardy. Among other features\, this allows for a resolution of the Lindley-Jeffreys paradox. When using a reference Beta B(a\,a) prior on the mixture weights\, we note that the sensitivity of the posterior estimations of the weights to the choice of a vanishes with the sample size increasing and advocate the default choice a=0.5\, derived from Rousseau and Mengersen (2011). Another feature of this easily implemented alternative to the classical Bayesian solution is that the speeds of convergence of the posterior mean of the weight and of the corresponding posterior probability are quite similar.

DESCRIPTION:Title:  Partial Identification Subnetwork Approach to Discrete Games in Large Networks: An Application to Quantifying Peer Effects”\n\nAbstract : This paper studies identification and estimation of discrete games in large networks\, with an application to peer effects on smoking in friend networks. Due to the presence of multiple equilibria\, the model is not point identified. We adopt the partial identification approach by constructing moment inequalities on choice probabilities of subnetworks. Doing so not only significantly reduces the computational cost\, but also enables us to find consistent estimator of the moment conditions even when the network is large and the friendship relationship structure varies significantly among networks. Monte Carlo studies are conducted to evaluate the performance of the subnetwork approach. In the application using the Add Health data\, we find significant and positive peer effects on smoking.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Improving mean-variance portfolio strategy using multiple graphical models\n \nAbstract: The inverse covariance matrix plays a crucial role in portfolio risk minimization\, as it prescribes the hedge trades in which a stock is hedged by all the other stocks in the portfolio. In practice with finite samples\, however\, the estimation errors in the inverse covariance matrix make the hedge trades too unstable and unreliable. In this project\, built upon the recent advances in multiple graphical models\, a “shrink” estimator of the inverse covariance matrix is proposed to handle these estimation errors with the goal of improving the performance of mean-variance portfolio. The proposed estimator is constructed by simultaneously shrinking the number of stocks involved in each “rolling” estimation window\, as well as shrinking the time-variation of the inverse covariance estimators across different estimation windows. The out-of-sample performance of portfolios formed on the proposed estimator is also examined throughout comparing with other existing methods (equal weighting\, industry factor model\, short-sales and turnover constraints\, shrunk covariance matrix (constructed for each estimation window separately)).

DESCRIPTION:Title: A Simple Under-Identification Tes for Linear IV-Models\, with an Application to Dynamic Panel Data Models\n\nAbstract: For linear IV models it is shown that standard under-identification tests like the Cragg-Donald and Kleibergen-Paap tests are Sargan type tests for instrument-error orthogonality in the linear IV model of one endogenous explanatory variable regressed on the others\, estimated by LIML. This insight can then be used to extend these type of tests to more complex data structures\, like dynamic panel data models\, leading to very simple to calculate tests for under-identification.

The possibility that heteroskedasticity identifies the structural parameters only partially is explicitly allowed for. The asymptotic properties of the identified parameters are derived. Moreover\, tests for identification through heteroskedasticity are developed and their asymptotic distributions are derived. Monte Carlo simulations are used to explore the small sample properties of the asymptotically valid methods. Finally\, the approach is applied to investigate the relation between the extent of economic openness and inflation.

DESCRIPTION:Abstract:  \nThis paper investigates the comparative advantage provided by the shale gas revolution to the US manufacturing sector. It estimates the response of several economic variables related to the manufacturing sector using dynamic panel data models that allow each sector's response to vary with its energy intensity. The paper shows that the decline in natural gas prices in the US relative to natural gas prices in Europe has led to an increase in industrial activity of nearly 2%. It also shows that exports increased by less than 1% and imports decreased by more than 1%. Moreover\, empirical evidence is provided that indicates structural breaks in the relationships between natural gas prices and imports or exports. However\, overall\, the paper concludes that\, even though the shale gas revolution helped some industries to expand\, it has not had a strong effect on the manufacturing sector as a whole.

DESCRIPTION:Constrained principal components estimation of large approximate factor models\n\nAbstract: Principal components (PC) are fundamentally feasible for the estimation of large factor models because consistency can be achieved for any path of the panel dimensions. The PC method is however inefficient under cross-sectional dependence with unknown structure. The approximate factor model of Chamberlain and Rothschild [1983] imposes a bound on the amount of dependence in the error term. This article proposes a constrained principal components (Cn-PC) estimator that incorporates this restriction as external information in the PC analysis of the data. This estimator is computationally tractable. It doesn't require estimating large covariance matrices\, and is obtained as PC of a regularized form of the data covariance matrix. The paper develops a convergence rate for the factor estimates and establishes asymptotic normality. In a Monte Carlo study\, we find that the Cn-PC estimators have good small sample properties in terms of estimation and forecasting performances when compared to the regular PC and to the generalized PC method (Choi [2012]).

SUMMARY:Prof. Pierre Pinson (DTU)
DESCRIPTION:Wind power forecasts with lead times up to a few hours are important for system operators and utilities to maintain a balanced and reliable power system. Commonly\, these forecasts are computed by time series models that are mainly based on past data from the forecast site. More advanced models additionally employ data from surrounding sites or can adapt to changes in the weather regime or wind farm setup. The wealth of data generated by an increasing number of wind power installations does not only provide possibilities for improvements but also challenges for common forecasting methodologies. We will introduce\, apply and discuss some of the recent proposals for high-dimensional modelling and forecasting\, mainly based on vector autoregression (VAR) and some generalization (for instance with regime-switching)\, as well as sparsification of coefficient matrices. This will first include the well-known Lasso VAR\, as well as an online version of that estimator. Furthermore\, alternative approaches to sparsification for VAR models will be presented and the balance between forecast accuracy and computational costs will be considered. Applications will be based on datasets with tens to hundreds of sites in Europe and Australia and perspectives for operational applications with thousands of sites will be discussed.

DESCRIPTION:TITLE: Testing for observation-dependent regime switching in mixture autoregressive models\n\nABSTRACT: Testing for regime switching when the regime switching probabilities are specified either as constants (‘mixture models’) or are governed by a finite-state Markov chain (‘Markov switching models’) are long-standing problems that have also attracted recent interest. This paper considers testing for regime switching when the regime switching probabilities are time-varying and depend on observed data (‘observation-dependent regime switching’). Specifically\, we consider the likelihood ratio test for observation-dependent regime switching in mixture autoregressive models. The testing problem is highly nonstandard\, involving unidentified nuisance parameters under the null\, parameters on the boundary\, singular information matrices\, and higher-order approximations of the log-likelihood. We derive the asymptotic null distribution of the likelihood ratio test statistic in a general mixture autoregressive setting using high-level conditions that allow for various forms of dependence of the regime switching probabilities on past observations\, and illustrate the theory using two particular mixture autoregressive models. The likelihood ratio test has a nonstandard asymptotic distribution that can easily be simulated\, and Monte Carlo studies show the test to have good finite sample size and power properties.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Inference for Iterated GMM Under Misspecification and Clustering (with Bruce Hansen)\n\nAbstract:\nThis paper proposes simple new inference methods for overidentified Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimation which correct the standard error bias which arises when moments are possibly misspecified. We focus on the iterated GMM estimator\, providing the first rigorous demonstration of existence\, and the first distribution theory for iterated GMM under moment misspecification. We show that inference theory for overidentified GMM can be simply recast as a just-identified higher-dimensional moment model\, simplifying and unifying inference methods. Our distribution theory is asymptotic\, allowing for either independent or clustered samples. We introduce a new set of asymptotic results for clustered data\, generalizing the classic laws of large numbers\, uniform laws\, and central limit theory\, to allow for clustered observations with heterogeneous and unbounded cluster sizes. Our simulation results show that our methods successfully remove the large biases in inference due to moment misspecification. We illustrate the method by replicating the application of Acemoglu\, Johnson\, Robinson\, and Yared (2008\, American Economic Review) and Cervellati\, Jung\, Sunde\, and Vischer (2014\, American Economic Review) about the causal effect of income on democracy. We find that Acemoglu et al's conclusion is further supported but Cervellati et al's findings become insignificant when the standard errors are corrected. \n\nSeminar organiser: Hsein Kew

We observe a discrete-time stochastic process {pt} at a subset of times {t1\, . . . \, tn} that depend on the outcome of a probabilistic sampling rule that depends on the history of the process as well as other observed covariates xt . We focus on a particular example where pt is the daily wholesale price of a standardized steel product. There are no formal exchanges or centralized markets where steel is traded and pt can be observed. Instead nearly all steel transaction prices are a result of private bilateral negotiations\, intermediated by middlemen known as steel service centers. We observe purchases by a particular firm—a steel service center that purchases large quantities of steel in the wholesale market for subsequent resale at a markup in the retail market. The endogenous sampling problem arises from the fact that the firm only records pt on the days that it purchases steel. We present a parametric analysis of this problem under the assumption that the timing of steel purchases is part of an optimal trading strategy that maximizes expected discounted trading profits. We derive a parametric partial information maximum likelihood (PIML) estimator and an alternative consistent\, less efficient\, but computationally simpler method of simulated moments (MSM) estimator that avoids high dimensional numerical integrations required by the PIML estimator. We use the MSM estimator to estimate a truncated lognormal AR(1) model of the wholesale price processes for particular types of steel plate. We infer the share of the middleman’s discounted profits that are due to markups\, and the share due to price speculation. The latter measures the firm’s success in forecasting steel prices and in timing its purchases in order to “buy low and sell high”. The more successful the firm is in speculation (i.e. in strategically timing its purchases)\, the more serious are the potential biases that would result from failing to account for the endogeneity of the sampling process. \n\nSeminar organiser: Hsein Kew

DESCRIPTION:Title: Weekly Hedonic House Price Indices: An Imputation Approach from a Spatio-Temporal Model\n\nabstract\nWe develop a method for computing house price indices at a weekly frequency using the hedonic imputation method. The price indices are computed using the Törnqvist superlative formula applied to matched samples derived from the hedonic model. Typically\, with the hedonic imputation method\, the model is estimated period-by-period and location is controlled for using postcode dummies. This may not be feasible at a weekly frequency. Instead\, we develop a spatio-temporal model represented in a state-space formulation that controls for location with a geospatial spline surface. The model is parsimonious and shadow price parameters are connected over time while retaining the property of non-revisability of the index as new time periods are added to the data set. We show the spatio-temporal specification leads to a modified form of the Kalman filter and a Goldberger's adjusted form of the predictor to obtain the imputations. Using data for Sydney (Australia) we show that weekly house price indices are much more sensitive than quarterly indices to the choice of hedonic method.  We then show using a novel criterion that our approach to computing house price indices at a weekly frequency outperforms competing alternatives.\n\nSeminar organiser: Wei Wei

DESCRIPTION:Title: On the Computational Complexity of Data Analysis in Spaces of Curves\n\nAbstract:\nTime series data is one of the most common forms of big data. More generally\, we can think of sequence data such as trajectories of moving objects and other geometric curves. Modern data analysis needs to be able to take such sequences or time series as input. In particular\, we need to be able to perform basic tasks such as clustering and classification on distributions of curves. The Frechet distance and is a well-studied geometric distance measure for curves that shares similarities with the popular dynamic time warping (DTW) distance. There is a large body of research on the complexity of computing and approximating the Frechet distance and DTW\, however it has a strong focus on computing single distances. This ignores the larger context in which the distance computation is usually invoked: clustering\, nearest-neighbor searching and range searching. In my talk I will describe some recent work in this area.\n\n\nBio: \nAnne Driemel received her PhD from Utrecht University in the Netherlands. She is assistant professor in the group on data mining at the Eindhoven Technical University. Her work is supported by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) through a Veni grant with the title "Clustering time series and trajectories". Her work focuses on the computational complexity of finding structure in curve data.

We investigate the limiting distribution of the common correlated effects estimator (Pesaran\, 2006) in a local asymptotic framework and show that the trade-off between bias and variance remains in the asymptotic theory. We then propose a focused information criterion and a plug-in averaging estimator for large heterogeneous panels and examine their theoretical properties. The novel feature of the proposed method is that it aims to minimize the sample analog of the asymptotic mean squared error and can be applied to cases irrespective of whether the rank condition holds or not. Monte Carlo simulations show that both proposed selection and averaging methods generally achieve lower expected squared error than other methods. The proposed methods are applied to analyze the consumer response to gasoline taxes.\n\nSeminar Organiser: Hsein Kew

Uncertainty Quantification for Regional Climate Projections in North America\n\nAbstract:\nOutput from a regional climate model (RCM) can be very-large-to-massive. Running several “flavours” of RCMs for identical time periods only adds to the data size. By modelling the RCM output statistically\, hierarchically\, and spatially\, where dimension reduction in the model is a practical imperative\, uncertainties can be quantified. In this talk\, emphasis is placed on directly summarising temperature increases by season from the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP). Analogous summaries are given of such increases obtained from predictive spatial distributions. To illustrate regional projected temperature increases from the fitted hierarchical spatial statistical model\, I feature the predictive distributions associated with the pixel that contains the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder\, Colorado\, the home of NARCCAP.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Reexamining financial and economic predictability with new estimators of realized variance\n\nAbstract: This paper explores the predictive power of new estimators of the conditional variance of the stock market returns and the equity variance risk premium for economic activity and financial instability. These estimators are obtained from new parametric and semiparametric asymmetric extensions of the heterogeneous autoregressive model. We find\, using the new specifications\, that the equity variance risk premium is a predictor of future stock returns while realized variance is often rejected as a predictor for short and moderate prediction horizons. Furthermore\, both variables are also predictors of financial instability and\, for some horizons\, of economic activity.\nAll in all\, new semiparametric models with asymmetric measures of realized variance improve considerably the predictive power of the variance risk premium when considering stock market returns and financial instability.\n\nSeminar organiser: Hsein Kew

DESCRIPTION:Title: Bayesian Estimation of Beta-type Distribution Parameters Based on Grouped Data\n\nAbstract: This study considers the estimation method of generalized beta (GB) distribution parameters based on grouped data from a Bayesian point of view. Because the GB distribution\, which was proposed by McDon-ald and Xu (1995)\, includes several kinds of familiar distributions as special or limiting cases\, it performs at least as well as those special or limiting distributions. Therefore\, it is reasonable to estimate the parameters of the GB distribution. This study uses a Tailored randomized block Metropolis–Hastings (TaRBMH) algorithm proposed by Chib and Ramamurthy (2010) to estimate the GB distribution parameters\, and this method is applied to one simulated and two real datasets. Moreover\, the Gini coefficients from the estimated parameters for the GB distribution are examined.\n\nSeminar organiser: Wei Wei

Whether a case is identified as an outlier depends on the other cases in the dataset\, on the variables available\, and on the criteria used.  A case can stand out as unusual on one or two variables\, while appearing middling on the others.  If a case is identified as an outlier\, it is useful to find out why.  This talk discusses the O3 plot (Overview Of Outliers) for supporting outlier analyses. O3 plots show which cases are often identified as outliers\, which are identified in single dimensions\, and which are only identified in higher dimensions.  They highlight which variables and combinations of variables may be affected by possible outliers.  Applications include a demographic dataset for the Bundestag constituencies in Germany and a university ranking dataset.

Our models are built as time-changed Lévy model. Lévy jumps reproduce tail risk. Time changes capture return stochastic volatility. To operationalize the models we use a simple but rigorous filtering approach. We derive the change of measure to conduct option pricing\, and investigate risk premia. An extensive time series and option pricing analysis of 14 time-changed Lévy models shows that two-factor tempered stable models fit index returns and option data particularly well.

DESCRIPTION:Title\n\nPoint Optimal Testing with Roots That are Functionally Local to Unity\n\nAbstract\n\nLimit theory for regressions involving local to unit roots (LURs) is now used extensively in time series econometric work\, establishing power properties for unit root and cointegration tests\, assisting the construction of uniform condence intervals for autoregressive coecients\, and enabling the development of methods robust to departures from unit roots. The present paper shows how to generalize LUR asymptotics to cases where the localized departure from unity is a time varying function rather than a constant. Such a functional local unit root (FLUR) model has much greater generality and encompasses many cases of additional interest that appear in practical work\, including structural break formulations that admit sub-periods of unit root\, local stationary and local explosive behavior within a given sample. Point optimal FLUR tests are constructed in the paper to accommodate such cases and demonstrate how the power envelope changes in case of practical interest. Against FLUR alternatives\, conventional constant point optimal tests can have extremely low power\, particularly when the departure from unity occurs early in the sample period for which a new analytic explanation is provided. Simulation results are reported and some implications for empirical practice are examined.

The findings suggest that individuals exhibit inconsistent risk appetite across different risk prospect. Using mutual fund data in the U.S. market\, we estimate fund managers’ preference parameters for stock and bond allocations\, respectively.

Unlike studies from other countries\, we find sharp bunching at all kink points in the Australian tax system. Elasticities of tax- able income range from effectively zero for wage earners to around 0.26 for self-employed tax-filers. We find substantial heterogeneity in responses to changes in marginal tax rates across a range of sub-groups\, with higher elasticities for married females\, females with children and younger tax-filers. Elasticities appear to be decreasing over time.

The method applies a kernel-based transformation to the original data and then uses the standard m out of n bootstrap for independent and identically distributed observations. The bootstrap method\, although akin to\, offers an improvement over the tapered block bootstrap\, admitting kernels with unbounded support. Given a suitable choice of kernel\, a kernel block bootstrap estimator of the spectrum at zero asymptotically close to the optimal Parzen (1957) estimator is possible. The higher order bias and variance of the kernel block bootstrap variance estimator are derived. Like the tapered block bootstrap\, the kernel block bootstrap has a favourable higher order bias property. The method is illustrated by an application to mean regression and the first-order asymptotic validity of the bootstrap approximation demonstrated.  Simulations indicate that the kernel block bootstrap may be efficacious in practice.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Spatial Chaining in International Comparisons of Prices and Real Incomes\n\nAbstract:\nMultilateral international comparisons of the purchasing power of currencies and\nreal income often use as building blocks bilateral comparisons between all possible\npairs of countries. The standard approach in the literature weights all these bilaterals\nequally. One problem with this approach is that some bilaterals are typically of lower\nquality\, and their inclusion therefore can undermine the integrity of the multilateral\ncomparison. Formulating multilateral comparisons as a graph theory problem\, we\nshow how quality can be improved by replacing bilateral comparisons with their\nshortest path spatially chained equivalents. We consider a few variants on this\napproach\, and illustrate these multilateral methods using data from the 2011 round\nof the International Comparisons Program (ICP). Using some novel bounds criteria\,\nwe demonstrate how spatial chaining improves the quality of the overall multilateral\ncomparison.

DESCRIPTION:Title:&nbsp\;<span>Estimating a Covariance Function from Fragments ofFunctional Dat</span><span>a</span><br><span><br></span><br><span>Abstract:&nbsp\;</span>Functional data are often observed only partially\, in the form of fragments. In that case\, the standard approaches for estimating the covariance function do not work because entire parts of the domain are completely unobserved. In previous work\, Delaigle and Hall (2013\, 2016) have suggested ways of estimating the covariance function\, based for example on Markov assumptions. In this work we take a completely different approach which does not rely on such assumptions. We show that\, using a tensor product approach\, it is possible to reconstruct the covariance function using observations located only on the diagonal of its domain.

DESCRIPTION:<br><br>Title: Lessons in Disaster: What Can We Learn From Data Analysis Failures?<br><br><br>Abstract: The details of data analysis failures are often not publicly observable\, making it difficult to develop a systematic understanding of how failures occur and how they can be prevented in the future. Most published analyses barely provide sufficient details of successful analyses\, much less any failures. Reproducible research is a concept that has been promoted recently as a way to increase transparency in analysis\, however it is not clear what value it has in preventing failure. I will discuss some case studies of widely publicized data analysis failures and attempt to distill what\, if any\, lessons we can take from these cases to improve future analyses.<p></p><br><p></p>

Where field data are available\, they are often used informally as “ground truth” for model calibration. Formal incorporation of theoretical relationships with data via the likelihood can be formulated as\, say\, a state-space model that gives rise to a well-defined likelihood\, or a black-box model that renders the likelihood intractable. In contrast\, Bayesian melding (Poole &amp\; Raftery\, 2000 in JASA) regards the theoretical model (black-box or otherwise) as part of the prior distribution\, formulated as the “melded prior.” Literature on Bayesian melding is well-established for deterministic mathematical models. For the stochastic case\, such as some agent based models\, formal derivation of the melded prior had been lacking. We propose a solution and apply it to an existing stochastic agent based model. To allow flexible formulations of likelihoods without sacrificing computational efficiency\, we employ an emulator alongside a posterior sampling algorithm that embeds sampling-importance-resampling within Metropolis-Hastings. The bulk of this joint work (in progress) appears in Dawkins (2017) (ANU Honours Thesis co-supervised by G. Chiu and A. Westveld).</font>

DESCRIPTION:Title: How Costly to Sell A Company? A Structural Analysis of Takeover Auctions\n\nAbstract: To explain why sellers in takeover auctions limit bidders' entry\, we structurally measure two negative effects of inviting an additional bidder on the seller's revenue: information cost and operation cost. In particular\, our auction model allows for bidders to discount their synergy values when their rivals obtain the confidential information {we refer to the induced revenue loss as the information cost. We establish the identication \nof the model primitives with unobserved heterogeneity\, naturally arising from the\ncondential information. From a sample with 287 M&A deals of U.S. public companies\,\nwe nd that the unobserved heterogeneity explains 75.3% of the variation of the value\nand bidders lower their values by 7.6% for each rival. We quantify the information\ncost and operation cost using counterfactual analysis\, and discuss policy implications\nfor the seller as well as regulatory and judiciary authorities.

DESCRIPTION:Title: The Realized Rotated BEKK Model\n\nAbstract:\nWe propose a multivariate realized GARCH model where the conditional\n\nvariance of daily returns depends on lagged realized measures of\nvolatility computed with high- frequency data. In turn\, a measurement\nequation contemporaneously links the realized measures and the\nconditional variance. To greatly reduce the number of parameters in\nthe measurement equation\, we use adaptive Lasso and the least-angle\nregression algorithm. For the GARCH dynamic of the conditional\nvariance\, we favor a diagonal BEKK structure applied to rotated\nvariables. Our empirical results suggest that the use of variable\nselection with adaptive Lasso for the measurement equation instead of\nOLS leads to improved out- of-sample forecasting performances.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Graph-based change-point test for high-dimensional data\n\nAbstract: A change-point test for high-dimensional data is presented by using a Bayesian-type statistic based on the shortest Hamiltonian path\, and the change-point is estimated by using ratio cut. A permutation procedure is applied to approximate the significance of Bayesian-type statistics. The change-point test is proven to be consistent\, and an error probability in change-point estimation is provided. The test is powerful against alternatives with a shift in variance and is accurate in change-point estimation\, as shown in simulation studies. Its applicability in tracking cell division is illustrated. Our other graph-based change-tests will also be briefly introduced.

This paper develops a method of robust inference\, and proposes a data-driven practical choice of trimming observations with small A. Our sense of the robustness is twofold. First\, bias correction allows for robustness against large trimming bias. Second\, adaptive inference allows for robustness against unknown convergence rate. The proposed method allows for closer-to-optimal trimming\, and more informative inference results in practice. This practical advantage is demonstrated for inverse propensity score weighting through simulation studies.

One application of this result is to estimate the variance of estimators of the extreme value index such as the Probability Weighted Moment (PWM) estimator. The context is the block maxima method or the peak-over-threshold method.

As a model for statistical inference\, it may be viewed as a multivariate extension of the familiar Bernoulli distribution\, within the exponential family of distributions. Using the fully-visible Boltzmann machine\, it is possible to fit networks of interactions between interacting binary random variables. Unfortunately\, direct maximum likelihood estimation is made difficult due to an awkward and computationally inconvenient normalisation coefficient. A maximum pseudolikelihood approach may be used to alleviate this computational problem\, making the estimation of fully-visible Boltzmann machines feasible.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Estimation of Treatment Effects under Endogenous Heteroskedasticity\n\nAbstract: This paper considers a treatment effects model in which individual treatment effects\nmay be heterogeneous\, even among observationally identical individuals. Specifically\, extending\nthe classical instrumental-variables (IV) model with an endogenous binary treatment and a binary\ninstrument\, we allow the heteroskedasticity of the error disturbance to depend upon the treatment\nvariable so that treatment generates both mean and variance effects on the outcome. We show that\nsuch an endogeneity of the heteroskedasticity can be detected from the residuals of the standard\nIV estimation. Moreover\, in this endogenous heteroskedasticity IV (EHIV) model\, the standard IV\nestimator can be inconsistent and lead to incorrect inference. After establishing nonparametric\nidentification\, we provide closed-form estimators for the linear EHIV for the mean and variance\ntreatment effects\, the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT)\, and the individual treatment\neffects (ITE). Asymptotic properties of the estimators are provided. A Monte Carlo simulation\ninvestigates the performance of the proposed approach. An empirical application regarding\nthe effects of fertility on female labor supply is considered\, and the findings demonstrate the\nimportance of accounting for endogenous heteroskedasticity.

These matrices form the basic input to the optimisation\, but they are not at all easy to obtain. Today\, it’s possible to measure your Internet traffic with tools such as Netflow\, but the traffic matrix requires more than just traffic data\; it requires a synthesis of traffic +routing + topology\, so it is still uncommon to see real instances. This talk will describe the history of exploration of these complex beasts in the Internet\, their measurement\, inference\, and application. And we’ll talk about our most recent work on modelling and synthesis of these using Maximum Entropy methods\, to provide techniques for the research community to use to generate synthetic traffic matrices.\n\nBio: Prof. Matthew Roughan is a Professor in the School of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Adelaide\, in South Australia and a Chief Investigator in the ARC Centre of Excellence for Mathematical & Statistical Frontiers (ACEMS).  His research interests range from stochastic modelling to measurement and management of networks like the Internet.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Robust Estimation and Inference for Importance Sampling Estimators with Infinite Variance \n\nAbstract: Importance sampling is a popular Monte Carlo method used in a variety of areas in econometrics. When the variance of the importance sampling estimator is infinite\, the central limit theorem does not apply and estimates tend to be erratic even when the simulation size is large. We consider asymptotic trimming in such a \nsetting. Specifically\, we propose a bias-corrected tail-trimmed estimator such that it is consistent and has finite variance. We show that the proposed estimator is asymptotically normal\, and has good finite-sample properties in a Monte Carlo study.

DESCRIPTION:Title: A Sparse Change-point VAR model (joint with Arnaud Dufays\, Zhuo Li and Jeroen Rombouts)\n\nAbstract: This paper proposes a sparse change-point vector autoregressive model\, or sparse CP-VAR\, \nto model multivariate time series subject to multiple unknown structural breaks. We relax the\nassumption that all parameters need to change when detecting automatically for structural\nbreaks in a VAR model. The approach is general such that breaks can happen in either the\nautoregressive parameters\, spillover parameters and variance matrix parameters. We achieve\nthis by shrinking irrelevant break-parameters towards zero in our estimation procedure which\nis based on a sampling scheme tailored to change-point models. Our shrinkage methodology\nalleviates the search of an optimal number of regimes and does only rely on one estimation\noutput. For generality\, breaks in the variance matrix are governed by a hierarchical Dirichlet\nprocess.

We examine the decision behaviour of pregnant women with private health insurance in choosing one of 18 local hospitals. We evaluate the importance of hospital reputation through two separate strands of analysis. Firstly\, we examine the distance patients travel between their home and the chosen clinic. In the second part of the paper we estimate the probability of individual hospitals being visited. We find significant clinic specific differences in the willingness to travel\, which suggests that patients travel further to attend more reputable institutions. This result is complemented by substantial variation in the likelihood of individual hospitals being chosen. These differences are predominantly linked to hospital criteria and performance indicators.

In these experiments participants predict an evolution of the endogenous time series of price of the financial asset. The realised price is a function of the average of the participants' forecasts. The functional form varies under different treatments. A peculiar feature of these experiments is that the resulting time series may vary qualitatively even under the same treatment: in some cases the convergence to the fundamental price is observed\, while in other cases the price exhibits volatility and repeated patterns of bubbles and crashes. To explain this variety of outcomes Anufriev and Hommes (2012) propose the Heuristic Switching Model where participants follow behavioural prediction heuristics and switch between them on the basis of their past performance.<br><br>In this paper we take Bayesian approach to estimate such a model on the available data from the previous learning-to-forecast experiments. The observed variable is the individual numerical point forecasts. In the experiment individuals may condition their forecasts on the price from the previous rounds displayed on the screen. We assume that the individual point forecasts are generated by certain unobserved behavioural forecasting heuristics (e.g.\, adaptive\, trend-following\, constant\, rational) and that individuals may switch between these heuristics. We parameterise this hidden Markov Model. The probabilities of switching are conditioned on the past performances of the rules. We estimate the parameters of the rules and the probabilities of choosing a specific rule by an individual at a given time using block Gibbs sampler. We find that individual switching is an important characteristics helping to explain experimental data as opposed to the constrained model without switching. Depending on the treatment (functional form of price determination) we observed prevalence of different sets of heuristics.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Option Pricing with Market Frictions and Regime Switching\n\nAbstract: Market frictional costs prevail in financial markets and play a significant role in asset pricing as well as other important areas in economics and finance. In this talk\, I shall discuss a modelling framework\, which aims to integrate the impacts of three fundamental features including market frictional costs\, regime switches and ambiguity on option prices. The ask and bid prices of a European option in such incomplete market are characterized as solutions of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations. An approach based on the minimization of a relative entropy is used to determine a fair value between the ask and bid prices. A simple closed-form solution to the minimization problem is obtained\, which indicates that the fair value does not price the regime-switching risk in the presence of market frictions. Numerical experiments on the model are conducted. The numerical results indicate the significance of incorporating market frictional costs in option valuation under the regime-switching environment.

While the drift term is typically ignored in the infill asymptotic theory and applications\, the presence of nonzero drifts is an undeniable fact. The finite sample theory and extensive simulations provided in this paper reveal that the drift component has a nonnegligible impact on the estimation accuracy of volatility and leads to a dramatic power loss of a class of jump identification procedures. We propose an alternative construction of volatility estimators and jump tests and observe significant improvement of both in the presence of nonnegligible drift. As an illustration\, we apply the new volatility estimators and jump tests\, along with their original versions\, to 21 years of 5-minute log-returns of the NASDAQ stock price index.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Bayesian Inference for Structural Vector Autoregressions Identified by Markov-Switching Heteroskedasticity\n\nAbstract: In this study\, Bayesian inference is developed for structural vector autoregressive models in which the structural parameters are identified via Markov-switching heteroskedasticity. In such a model\, restrictions that are just-identifying in the homoskedastic case\, become over-identifying and can be tested. A set of parametric restrictions is derived under which the structural matrix is globally or partially identified and a Savage-Dickey density ratio is used to assess the validity of the identification conditions. For that purpose\, a new probability distribution is defined that generalizes the beta\, F\, and compound gamma distributions. As an empirical example\, monetary models are compared using heteroskedasticity as an additional device for identification. \nThe empirical results support models with money in the interest rate reaction function.\n\nThis is joint work with Helmut Lutkepohl

We decompose the slope coefficient vector into a common component\, an individual heterogeneity component and a time heterogeneity component. Due to the fact that one can not eliminate either the individual or time heterogeneity in the slope coefficients through the usual demeaning or differencing procedure and that the separate estimates of the individual and time heterogeneity components via respective time series and cross-sectional regressions are generally inconsistent when these components are allowed to be correlated with the regressors\, we propose to generalize the fixed effects estimator to estimate these three components along with the traditional individual and time fixed effects in the models under suitable identification restrictions. To establish the asymptotic properties of the generalized fixed effects (GFE) estimators\, we invert a number of large dimensional square matrices by approximating them with quasi-Kronecker structured matrices. We establish the asymptotic normality of our GFE estimators by characterizing their asymptotic biases and variances. The convergence rates of our estimators depend on the unknown degrees of individual and time heterogeneity. To make a uniform inference on the common slope component\, we propose a novel triple-bootstrap procedure to estimate the asymptotic variance of our GFE estimators which are valid uniformly over a broad space of parameter heterogeneity. Simulations show the superb performance of our estimators in various scenarios. We apply our method to study the relationship between savings and investments in a cross-countries study. We find significant parameter heterogeneity along both the individual and time dimensions and provide some new insight to explain the Feldstein--Horioka puzzle. &nbsp\;

Vahey  (University of Warwick and CAMA)\, Elizabeth C. Wakerly (EPS and CAMA) \n\nAbstract: Many studies have found that combining forecasts improves forecast accuracy. An often-used approach developed by Granger and Ramanathan (GR\, 1984) utilises a linear-Gaussian regression model to combine point forecasts. This paper generalises their approach for an asymmetrically distributed target variable. Our copula point forecast combination methodology involves fitting marginal distributions for the target variable and the individual forecasts being combined\; and then estimating the correlation parameters capturing linear dependence. If the target variable is Gaussian distributed\, the copula point combination collapses to the GR combination. We illustrate our methodology with two applications based on macroeconomic variables that are asymmetrically distributed. The first application examines real-time forecasts for the Federal Funds rate. The second application considers forecasts for US output growth. The copula point combinations outperform the individual forecasts and conventional GR combinations in both applications.

More importantly\, it highlights the assumptions underlying methods such as difference-in-differences and synthetic control\, suggesting ways to test these assumptions. Gains from simple and transparent time series models are analysed using examples from the literature\, including the California smoking law of 1989 and German re-unification. We argue that selecting controls using a time series strategy is preferable to existing data-driven regression methods.

Our study uses a unique dataset of the ages at death - in days - of all (about 285\,000) Dutch residents\, born in the Netherlands\, who died in the years 1986-2015 at a minimum age of 92 years and is based on extreme value theory\, the coherent approach to research problems of this type. Unlike some other studies we base our analysis on the configuration of thousands of mortality data of old people\, not just the few oldest old. We find compelling statistical evidence that there is indeed an upper limit to the life span of men and to that of women for all the 30 years we consider and\, moreover\, that there are no indications of trends in these upper limits over the last 30 years\, despite the fact that the number of people reaching high age (say 95 years) was almost tripling. We also present estimates for the endpoints\, for the force of mortality at very high age\, and for the so-called perseverance parameter.

We find that the trend in global temperatures and greenhouse gases is common indicating a stable long-run relationship between them. We also find extra cycles in global temperatures that improves in-sample and out-of-sample forecasts of our regression model. Finally\, we explore the direction of causation in the co-trending relationship as a theoretical foundation for the control of global warming by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

DESCRIPTION:<b>Title:</b> The Bias in Pseudo-Out-of-Sample-Testing<br><br><b>Abstract:</b> This paper links Efron's bootstrap measurement of over-fitting\, called ``optimism''  (Efron\, 2004)\, with Diebold-Mariano tests (Diebold and Mariano\, 1995).  The link is made by rendering out-of-sample tests as special cases of cross validation\, and in turn linking cross validation with Efron's optimism.  Using these links\, I demonstrate why popular sample-splitting applications of Diebold-Mariano tests\, which Diebold calls ``pseudo-out-of-sample-tests''\, are noisy and can be subject to significant bias against good models.  I examine real models that predict equity market returns\, in which pseudo-out-of-sample-tests appear to be extremely biased against potentially valuable models.  And I present a simulation study supporting my analytic results.  I propose an adjustment to Diebold-Mariano tests\, by incorporating Efron's bootstrap estimate of over-fitting\, that may ameliorate the problems.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Almost Similar Tests for Mediation Effects and other Hypotheses with Singularities\n\nAbstract: Testing for mediation effects is empirically important and theoretically interesting. It is empirically important in psychology\, medicine\, accountancy\, and marketing for instance\, and leads to a theoretically interesting and long-standing problem in statistics that this paper solves. The no-mediation effect hypothesis\, expressed as H₀:θ₁θ₂=0\, defines a manifold that is non-regular in the origin where the size and power of standard tests\, including the Wald\, LR\, and LM tests\, are extremely low. The statistical challenge is to find a similar test with correct size independent of θ₁ and θ₂. We solve this problem by considering the critical region directly\, rather than defining a test statistic and trying to correct its critical value. We prove the interesting theoretical result that no similar test exists\, even if the asymptotic normal approximation is used. Despite this negative theoretical finding\, we are able to construct a critical region that is all but similar and can be used in practice. We extend this result to three dimensions and show how it can be extended to higher dimensions for null hypotheses of the form H₀:θ₁θ₂⋯=0 with singularities at the origin.

DESCRIPTION:Title: From Strength to Strength: Extensions of the Elo Rating System for Margin of Victory\n\nThe Elo rating system is one of the most popular methods for estimating competitor ability over time in sport. The standard Elo system focuses on expectations about wins and losses but there is often interest in the margin of victory (MOV) as it reflects the strength of a performance. Theory for and comparisons of these types of models are limited. In this talk\, I will present four model options for an MOV Elo system: linear\, joint additive\, multiplicative\, and logistic. The talk will include a presentation of notation for each model\, guidance on model tuning\, and implementation examples in R. I will also provide real-world applications to professional tennis and discuss how MOV Elo models can have an impact at tennis events like the Australian Open. This general framework for MOV Elo ratings gives sports modellers a new set of tools when building systems to rate competitors and forecast outcomes in sport.

DESCRIPTION:<b>Title:</b> Forecasting the European Carbon Market Return Using Data Reduction Techniques<br><br><b>&nbsp\;Abstract: </b>This paper examines whether the European Carbon Market Return can be forecast at the weekly horizon. A wide range of potential predictors are considered including other Energy returns\, non-energy commodity returns and returns on other financial assets. Data reduction techniques are examined following Kim and Swanson (2014) including Principal components to generate factors and shrinkage methods (Bayesian model averaging\, statistical learning and penalized regression) to select functions and weights for the factors. We generally find that the data reduction techniques are effective for the Carbon market return both in improving forecast accuracy and in generating abnormal returns in a portfolio allocation exercise. In terms of forecast accuracy improvements of around 2-3% at a one-week horizon is possible over the benchmark which is statistically significant using tests of equal forecast accuracy (CW test\, MSE-F test) and encompassing (ENC-NEW). In terms of economic value we consider the optimal portfolio allocation of a mean-variance optimising investor between the risk-free rate and the carbon market. Initial results indicate that annualised utility gains of 10% are feasible where portfolio weights are restricted to be between 0 and 1 or as much as 20% when leverage of 50% is allowed and weights in each asset are between -0.5 and 1.5.&nbsp\;&nbsp\;<br>(co-authored with Tan\, X.\, Sirichand\, K. and Wang\, X.)

DESCRIPTION:Title:  CAT Bond Pricing under a Product Probability Measure with EVT Risk Characterization\n\nAbstract:  Frequent large losses from recent catastrophes have caused great concerns among insurers/reinsurers\, who then turn to seek mitigations of such catastrophe risks by issuing catastrophe (CAT) bonds and thereby transferring the risks to the bond market. Whereas\, the pricing of CAT bonds remains a challenging task\, mainly due to the facts that the CAT bond market is incomplete and that the pricing usually requires knowledge about the tail of the risks. In this paper\, we propose a general pricing framework based on a product pricing measure\, which combines a distorted probability measure that prices the catastrophe risks underlying the CAT bond with a risk-neutral probability measure that prices interest rate risk. We also demonstrate the use of the peaks over threshold (POT) method to uncover the tail risk. Finally\, we conduct case studies using Mexico and California earthquake data to demonstrate the applicability of our pricing framework. \n\n\n\nThis talk is based on the following paper: Tang\, Q. and Yuan\, Z.\, 2019.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Inference for GMM under Misspecification\n\nAbstract: This paper develops a new distribution theory and inference methods for over-identified Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimation focusing on the iterated GMM estimator\, allowing for moment misspecification\, and for clustered dependence with heterogeneous and growing cluster sizes. This paper is the first to provide a rigorous theory for the iterated GMM estimator. We provide conditions for its existence by demonstrating that the iteration sequence is a contraction mapping. Our asymptotic theory allows the moments to be possibly misspecified\, which is a general feature of approximate over-identified models. This form of moment misspecification causes bias in conventional standard error estimation. Our results show how to correct for this standard error bias. Our paper is also the first to provide a rigorous distribution theory for the GMM estimator under cluster dependence. Our distribution theory is asymptotic\, and allows for heterogeneous and growing cluster sizes. Our results cover standard smooth moment condition models\, including dynamic panels\, which is a common application for GMM with cluster dependence. Our simulation results show that conventional heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors are highly biased under moment misspecification\, severely understating estimation uncertainty\, and resulting in severely over-sized hypothesis tests. In contrast\, our misspecification-robust standard errors are approximately unbiased and properly sized under both correct specification and misspecification. We illustrate the method by extending the empirical work reported in Acemoglu\, Johnson\, Robinson\, and Yared (2008\, American Economic Review) and Cervellati\, Jung\, Sunde\, and Vischer (2014\, American Economic Review). Our results reveal an enormous effect of iterating the GMM estimator\, demonstrating the arbitrariness of using one-step and two-step estimators. Our results also show a large effect of using misspecification robust standard errors instead of the Arellano-Bond standard errors. Our results support Acemoglu\, Johnson\, Robinson\, and Yared's conclusion of an insignificant effect of income on democracy\, but reveal that the heterogeneous effects documented by Cervellati\, Jung\, Sunde\, and Vischer are less statistically significant than previously claimed.\n\n\nThe paper can be found here:\nhttps://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/papers/IteratedGMM.html

DESCRIPTION:<b>Title: </b>Embedding virtual simulations into statistics classes to improve student engagement and satisfaction.<br><br><b>Abstract: </b>Background: There is currently a deficit of statistical graduates in Australia. As of 2011\, only 0.46% of all Australian students graduated with a mathematical or statistical background\, falling well below the OECD average of 1.19%. Whilst there are several potential reasons for this\, the Office of the Chief Scientist have suggested that this is due to students (across primary\, secondary and tertiary levels) finding mathematical and statistics classes boring\, unengaging and impractical. At a tertiary level\, many statistics students often find themselves simply provided a data set and asked to analysed the results and interpret the findings. Such tasks sees students missing out on major components of the Problem Solving Approach\, PSA\, (such as plan and collect)\, which results in students not appreciating or fully understanding their data.&nbsp\;<br><br>Problem: However\, instructors do not simply choose to omit specific steps from the PSA\, but rather\, because they are limited by ethical and classroom constraints. For example\, it would be rather unethical for Biostatistics or Epidemiological students to collect their own data on infectious diseases\, and thus they would simply be provided with pre-collected data.&nbsp\;<br>Method: To overcome the issue of ethical and classroom constraints\, I have attempted to embed virtual simulations into my teaching and assessment tasks. This allows students to collect realistic data without violating any ethical and practical barriers presented by real research.&nbsp\;<br>Results and Discussion: Overall\, embedding virtual simulations into my teaching and assessment tasks saw an improvement in student attitudes and satisfaction. This presentation will discuss these results and address the implications and limitations of this research.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Comparing Deep Neural Network and Econometric Approaches to Predicting the Impact of Climate Change on Agricultural Yield\n\nAbstract: Predicting the impact of climate change on crop yield is difficult\, in part because the production function mapping weather to yield is high dimensional and nonlinear. We compare three approaches to predicting yields: (i) deep neural networks (DNNs)\, (ii) traditional panel-data models\, and (iii) a new panel-data model that allows for unit and time fixed-effects in both intercepts and slopes in the agricultural production function - made feasible by a new estimator developed by Neal (2018) called MO-OLS. Using U.S. county-level corn yield data from 1950-2015\, we show that both DNNs and MO-OLS models outperform traditional panel data models for predicting yield\, both in-sample and in a Monte Carlo cross-validation exercise. However\, the MO-OLS model substantially outperforms both DNNs and traditional panel-data models in forecasting yield in a 2006-15 holdout sample. Finally\, we compare the predictions of all these models for climate change impacts on corn yield from the present to 2100.

DESCRIPTION:TITLE: Structural Inference Using VARMAs with Heteroskedastic Errors\n\nABSTRACT:\nWe show that allowing for time variation in the covariances of conditionally Gaussian vector autoregressive moving average (VARMA) models induces uniqueness in terms of fundamental and various non-fundamental representations. Hence\, it resolves an important issue in applying multivariate time series models to structural macroeconomic problems.  At the same time\, heteroskedasticity has been repeatedly identified as an essential feature of economic time-series data\, so introducing it in VARMA modeling is a natural extension.  Although computation in this setting is more challenging\, the conditionally Gaussian nature of the model renders efficient sampling algorithms feasible. We further develop Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithms for VARMAs with fixed coefficients and various stochastic volatility specifications. Monte Carlo evidence based on DGPs derived from callibrated DSGE models demonstrate that the algorithm performs well in practice.  We further employ the algorithm to assess the effect of shock anticipation (or foresight) on inference about impulse response functions.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Leveraging Brand Equity for Effective Visual Product Design\n\nAbstract: For many consumer goods\, the visual appearance is a major determinant of market success.\nWhile there is an emerging literature on how objective design characteristics drive consumer\npreferences\, this literature has not yet taken into account that product design happens in the\ncontext of a brand’s equity. This research addresses the question of how to leverage brand equity\nwhen designing the visual appearance of a product. Specifically\, it investigates the role of two\nkey strategic visual design decisions: brand typicality (similarity within the brand’s range) and\nsegment typicality (similarity to the competitive set). Based on fluency theory\, the paper argues\nthat high equity brands benefit more from brand typicality but less from segment typicality than\nlow equity brands. Using data from the US car market tracking market shares of 456 car models\nof 39 major brands operating in seven market segments across 13 years\, the study provide\nempirical evidence for this conjecture and derive implications for strategic product design visual\nand design theory.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Improving Finite Sample Approximation by Central Limit Theorems for DEA and FDH efficiency scores\n\nAbstract: We propose an improvement of the finite sample approximation of the central limit theorems (CLTs) that were recently derived for statistics involving production efficiency scores estimated via Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) or Free Disposal Hull (FDH) approaches. The improvement is very easy to implement since it involves a simple correction of the variance estimator with an estimate of the bias of the already \nemployed statistics without any additional computational burden and preserves the original asymptotic results such as consistency and asymptotic normality. The proposed approach persistently showed improvement in all the scenarios that we tried in various Monte-Carlo experiments\, especially for relatively small samples or relatively large dimensions (measured by total number of inputs and outputs) of the underlying production model. This approach therefore is expected to produce more accurate estimates of confidence intervals of aggregates of individual efficiency scores in empirical research using DEA or FDH approaches and so must be valuable for practitioners. We also illustrate this method using a popular agricultural data set (from International Rice Research Institute) to confirm that the difference in the estimated confidence intervals can be substantial. A step-by-step implementation algorithm of the proposed approach is included in the Appendix.

DESCRIPTION:Title: The Effect of Minimum Wage Increases on Wages\, Hours Worked and Job Loss\n\n \nAbstract: Australia has a detailed system of ‘awards’ that specify different minimum wages depending on the industry\, location and skill of an employee. Using job-level data from a survey of firms\, this paper examines the effect of award wage changes on wages\, hours worked and the job destruction rate. I exploit the fact that between 1998 and 2008\, award wages were increased by a flat dollar amount each year (say\, 50 cents per hour)\, irrespective of existing award wage levels. This led to larger award wage rises in percentage terms for jobs whose award wages were relatively low\, compared to those on higher award wages. I find that adjustments to awards are almost fully passed on to wages in award-reliant jobs. I find no evidence that these small\, incremental increases in award wages have an adverse effect on hours worked or the job destruction rate.

The method is based on explicitly linking observed shape characteristics of the implied volatility surface to the coefficient functions that define the stochastic volatility model. The method can be applied to estimate a fully flexible nonparametric model\, or to estimate by GMM any arbitrary parametric stochastic volatility model\, affine or not. Empirical evidence based on S&P 500 index option data show that the method is stable and performs well out-of-sample.

DESCRIPTION:Title:  Identifying the number of factors from singular values of a large sample auto-covariance matrix\n\nAbstract:\nIdentifying the number of factors in a high-dimensional dynamic factor models has attracted much attention in recent years and a general solution to the problem is still lacking. A promising ratio estimator based on the singular values of the lagged autocovariance matrix has been recently proposed in the literature and is shown to have a good performance under some specific assumption on the strength of the factors. In  this paper\, we  propose  a complete theory of such sample singular values for both the factor part and the noise part under the large-dimensional scheme where the dimension and the sample size proportionally grow to infinity. In particular\, we provide the exact description of the phase transition phenomenon that determines whether a factor is strong enough to be detected with the observed sample singular values. Based on these findings and as a second main contribution of the paper\, we propose a new estimator of the number of factors which is strongly consistent for the detection of all significant factors (which are the only theoretically detectable ones). In particular\, factors are assumed to have the minimum strength above the phase transition boundary which is of the order of a constant\; they are thus not required to grow to infinity together with the dimension (as assumed in most of the existing papers on high-dimensional factor models). Empirical Monte-Carlo study as well as the analysis of stock returns data attest a very good performance of the proposed estimator. In all the tested cases\, the new estimator largely outperforms the existing estimator using the same ratios of singular values.

It not only links the covariance of responses to heterogeneous similarity matrices induced by auxiliary information\, but also establishes the relationship between the mean of responses and covariates. Under this new model setting\, however\, the consistency of the covariance estimator based on the standard profile likelihood approach breaks down. Hence\, we propose an adjustment and develop the Z-estimation and unconstrained/constrained ordinary least squares estimation methods. We demonstrate that the resulting estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal. In addition\, we introduce two diagnostic tests to assess the adequacy of the covariance-mean regression model and then obtain their theoretical properties. The proposed estimators and tests are illustrated via extensive simulations and a real example study of the stock return comovement in the US stock market.\n\nKey Words: Adjusted profile score function\; covariance-mean regression\; hypothesis testing\; multivariate regression

DESCRIPTION:<b>Title:</b> A regime-switching stochastic volatility model for forecasting electricity prices<br><br><b>Abstract:</b> This paper addresses three crucial challenges outstanding in the area of electricity price forecasting. Specifically\, we show the importance of considering fundamental price drivers in modelling\, develop new techniques for probabilistic (i.e. interval or density) forecasting of electricity prices\, and introduce a universal Bayesian technique for model comparison. We propose a new regime-switching stochastic volatility model with three regimes\, which may be interpreted as negative jump or “drop”\, normal price or “base”\, and positive jump or “spike”\, respectively. The transition matrix between these regimes is allowed to depend on explanatory variables in a novel way\, using an underlying ordered probit model. Bayesian inference is employed in order to obtain predictive densities. The main focus of the paper is on short-term density forecasting in the Nord Pool intraday market. We show that the proposed model outperforms several benchmark models at this task\, as measured by their predictive Bayes factors. In particular\, the incorporation of stochastic volatility\, regime switching\, information from the day-ahead market\, and exogenous information from weather reports into the model are all shown to improve its predictive performance\, without falling prey to curse of dimensionality problems.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Quantile Treatment Effects with Two-Sided Measurement Error\n\nAbstract: This paper considers quantile effects when there is measurement error both in the outcome variable and in a continuous "treatment" variable while allowing for other covariates that are not measured with error.  We identify these effects under two key conditions (i) the quantiles of the outcome and the quantile of the treatment are linear in the covariates and (ii) the measurement errors are "classical."  In our framework\, no instruments are required nor are repeated measures\, and we do not need to impose distributional assumptions on the measurement errors.  We develop two-step semiparametric estimators of the parameters of interest that are straightforward to implement in practice. We apply our method to study intergenerational income mobility.  Using NLSY data on annual income of parents and children\, we find that accounting for measurement error tends to decrease estimated intergenerational mobility across several nonlinear measures of intergenerational income mobility.

DESCRIPTION:Title: International macro-financial linkages matter: estimating finance-adjusted output gaps in G7 countries\n\nAbstract: We estimate finance neutral potential output and the corresponding output gaps for the G7 countries. Each country's output gap is driven by a global macro and a global macro-financial cycle\, as well as country specific factors in macro and financial variables. To this end\, we develop an international multivariate unobserved components model to disentangle real GDP\, credit and house prices in their trend and cyclical components. The latter are modeled as a dynamic factor model\, which allows us to identify global factors in real GDP and the financial variables. The ‘globally’ finance-adjusted output gaps show patterns of overheating prior to the financial crisis and they tend to be negative for a longer period after the crisis when compared to a benchmark output gap. A variance decomposition reveals that the global macro-financial cycle and also country-specific macro-finance factors are major drivers of the output gaps in the G7 countries.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Identification Robust Inference for Risk Prices in Structural Stochastic Volatility Models\n\nAbstract: In structural stochastic volatility asset pricing models\, changes in volatility affect risk premia through two channels: (1) the investor’s willingness to bear high volatility in order to get high \nexpected returns as measured by the market return risk price\, and (2) the investor’s direct aversion to changes in future volatility as measured by the volatility risk price. Disentangling these\nchannels is difficult and poses a subtle identification problem that invalidates standard inference.\nWe adopt the discrete-time exponentially affine model of Han\, Khrapov\, and Renault (2018)\,\nwhich links the identification of the volatility risk price to the leverage effect. In particular\, we\ndevelop a minimum distance criterion that links the market return risk price\, the volatility risk\nprice\, and the leverage effect to well-behaved reduced-form parameters that govern the return\nand volatility’s joint distribution. The link functions are almost flat if the leverage effect is\nclose to zero\, making estimating the volatility risk price difficult. We translate the conditional\nquasi-likelihood ratio test that Andrews and Mikusheva (2016) develop in a nonlinear GMM\nframework to a minimum distance framework. The resulting conditional quasi-likelihood ratio\ntest is uniformly valid. We invert this test to derive robust confidence sets that provide correct\ncoverage for the risk prices regardless of the leverage effect’s magnitude.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Uncertainty and the macroeconomy: A real-time out-of-sample evaluation\n\nAbstract: Many economic uncertainty measures have been proposed during the last decade. They are all imperfect proxies of a latent entity and are supposed to be related to output variables. This paper identifies and classifies 15 monthly uncertainty measures based on how they measure economic uncertainty. We show that there is an underlying factor structure and identify two interpretable factors. First\, a general economic uncertainty factor with a slight tilt toward financial conditions. Second\, a consumer/media confidence index which remains elevated after recessions. Furthermore\, we conduct a real-time out-of-sample forecasting analysis on the mean and quantiles of the four coincident variables (industrial production\, employment\, personal income\, and manufacturing and trade sales) to assess whether the relationship with output variables holds out-of-sample. The uncertainty factors hold little predictive power for the mean\, but are informative when forecasting the lower quantiles -- the left tail -- of industrial production and in particular employment. This suggests a nonlinear relationship between economic uncertainty and output.

DESCRIPTION:【Title】：Estimating Endogenous Treatment Effect Using High-Dimensional Instruments with an Application to the Olympic Effect\n\n【Abstract】：Endogenous treatments are commonly encountered in program evaluations using observational data where the selection-on-observables assumption does not hold. In this paper\, we develop a two-stage approach to estimate endogenous treatment effects using high-dimensional instrumental variables. In the first stage\, instead of using a linear reduced form regression in the conventional two-stage least squares approach\, we propose a new high-dimensional logistic reduced form model with the SCAD penalty to approximate the optimal instrument. In the second stage\, we replace the original treatment variable by its estimated propensity score and run a least squares regression to obtain the penalized Logistic-regression Instrumental Variables Estimator (LIVE). We show that the proposed LIVE is root-n consistent to the true average treatment effect\, asymptotically normal and achieves the semiparametric efficiency bound. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the LIVE outperforms the traditional TSLS estimator and the post-Lasso estimator for the endogenous treatment effects. Moreover\, in the empirical study\, we investigate whether the Olympic Games could facilitate the host nation's economic growth using data from 163 countries. The proposed LIVE estimator shows a strong Olympic effect on the host nation's economic growth.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Identification of SVAR Models by Combining Sign Restrictions With External Instruments\n\nAbstract: \nWe discuss combining sign restrictions with information in external instruments (proxy variables) to identify structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) models. We distinguish two scenarios that are relevant for SVAR practitioners. In the first\, we assume the availability of valid external instruments. Here\, sign restrictions can be imposed to identify additional shocks\, or to further disentangle the effects of shocks to be identified by external instruments. In the latter case\, these restrictions eventually become overidentifying and can be checked against the data. In the second scenario\, we assume the availability of proxy variables without assuming their exogeneity. We propose to use knowledge on the relation between proxy variables and the structural shocks to sharpen the results from set-identifying sign restrictions. We discuss Bayesian inference and the estimation of marginal likelihoods and Bayes factors\, which allows us to check overidentifying restrictions. In empirical applications we illustrate the usefulness of our method estimating the effects of oil market and monetary policy shocks

DESCRIPTION:Title: Fiscal Multipliers: Playing with Multiple Instruments\n\nWe estimate fiscal spending and tax multipliers for the US economy by employing different combinations of fiscal and non-fiscal instruments in a proxy-SVAR framework. We do so by working with a novel identification strategy which allows us to jointly estimate the multipliers and assess the overall validity of the SVAR specification. We provide robust evidence in favor of a fiscal spending multiplier larger than one. Turning to the tax multiplier\, we show that the strikingly different results one finds in the literature on small vs. large tax multipliers can be replicated by allowing one non-fiscal instrument (total factor productivity) to proxy different sets of shocks (output shocks only vs. output and tax shocks jointly). In particular\, we show that assuming total factor productivity to be orthogonal to tax shocks implies a tax multiplier around one. However\, if this orthogonality assumption is relaxed\, the tax multiplier is estimated to be three times larger and in line with what the proxy-SVAR literature finds when using fiscal proxies for the tax shocks.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Heterogeneity in auction price distributions for Australian Indigenous artists\n\nAbstract: Studies of auction prices for artworks typically relate the conditional moments of a single realised price distribution with either characteristics of the artist\, the artwork and the auction or with pre-sale information. Using data from the Australian Art Sales Digest for the one hundred top selling Australian Indigenous artists over the period 1987 to 2014 we use two alternative ways to understand heterogeneity in auction prices. Our results complement the existing literature by identifying new ways in which factors used in the literature may be related to price heterogeneity in a differentiated market such as that for Australian Indigenous art.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Evaluating Consumers’ Choices of Medicare Part D Plans: A Study in Behavioral Welfare Economics\n\n\n\nAbstract: We propose new methods to model behavior and conduct welfare analysis in complex \nenvironments where some choices are unlikely to reveal preferences. We develop a mixture-of-\nexperts model that incorporates heterogeneity in consumers’ preferences and in their choice\nprocesses. We also develop a method to decompose logit errors into latent preferences versus\noptimization errors. Applying these methods to Medicare beneficiaries’ prescription drug\ninsurance choices suggests that: (1) average welfare losses from suboptimal choices are small\,\n(2) beneficiaries with dementia and depression have larger losses\, and (3) policies that simplify\nchoice sets offer small average benefits\, helping some people but harming others.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Estimating the Economy-Wide Rebound Effect Using Empirically Identified Structural Vector Autoregressions\n\nAbstract: The size of the economy-wide rebound effect is crucial for estimating the contribution that energy efficiency improvements can make to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and for understanding the drivers of energy use. Existing estimates\, which vary widely\, are based on computable general equilibrium models or partial equilibrium econometric estimates. Using a structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) model\, we identify the dynamic causal impact of structural shocks\, including an energy efficiency shock. The identification method is based on independent component analysis. In this manner\, we are able to estimate the rebound effect with a minimum of a priori assumptions. We apply the SVAR to U.S. monthly and quarterly data\, finding that after four years rebound is around 100%\, which implies that in the long run no energy is saved.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Why Waste Your Vote? Informal Voting in Compulsory Elections in Australia \n\nAbstract: Voter turnout in mature democracies tends to range from around 50-70%. Low\, for something as critical as electing policymakers\, but much higher than basic economic theory would predict. Even in Australia\, where voting is compulsory\, there are still around 5-6% of voters who submit an informal vote\, which does not count towards the total. We make use of a natural experiment\, based on exogenous changes in electorate boundaries\, to identify what factors influence the number of wasted votes. In advance from the existing literature\, we test a range of potential contributing factors together\, in a single model\, and with causal interpretation. We find that factors that feature in the traditional theory on voter decisions\, competitiveness and number of other voters\, do not affect the rate of informal voting. Instead\, we find that more candidates on the ballot results in higher levels of informal voting. This effect is present regardless of the level of education\, which indicates that it is likely to be associated with a decision by the voter to abstain rather than an error. We conclude that making the way voters can express their preferences as simple as possible would be beneficial for reducing wasted votes.

This consolidation was slow and therefore we seek to learn the role of FCC policy in affecting the speed of geographic consolidation. We use the history of mergers to estimate a structural model of mergers that incorporates externalities. The externalities arise from post-merger competition for consumers. We demonstrate properties of the model and introduce new estimation techniques.

DESCRIPTION:“Impact of Prior Choices: Sensitivity Analysis of MCMC inference via Posterior Manifolds with Application to Food Price Elasticity Analysis under Expert Priors”\,\n\njoint work with Chun Fung Kwok\, Nhung Nghiem and Andrés Ramírez-Hassan\n\n\n\nAbstract: Bayesian MCMC analysis typically proceeds with conjugate priors for their mathematical and computational convenience. The main prior beliefs are then specified via the hyperparameters of these prior distributions. Existing approaches for Bayesian sensitivity of these prior choices are generally limited to low-dimensional and local analysis (in a form of derivatives or point evaluations) due to the computational and analytical complexity of the large (hyper-) parameter spaces. In this paper we introduce a computational approach to extend prior sensitivity analysis of posterior Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference beyond the point-wise and one-dimensional perspective. We exploit results on Gaussian processes to generate and analyse manifolds of posterior measures over subsets of the hyper-parameter space. And we also draw on recent advances in Automatic Differentiation for MCMC local sensitivity analysis to improve the precision of the manifolds in higher-dimensional cases. The manifolds lead to new graphical and numerical measures of robust\, and they help researchers specify and assess the (elicited) prior location and precision parameters. We apply our approach to investigate the prior sensitivity of food price elasticity within a popular multivariate demand system using data from a  unique virtual supermarket experiment and expert prior information.

DESCRIPTION:Marginally-calibrated deep distributional regression\n\nDeep neural network (DNN) regression models are widely used in applications\nrequiring state-of-the-art predictive accuracy. However\, until recently\nthere has been little work on accurate uncertainty quantification for\npredictions from such models. We add to this literature by outlining an\napproach to constructing predictive distributions that are `marginally\ncalibrated'. This is where the long run average of the predictive\ndistributions of the response variable matches the observed empirical\nmargin. Our approach considers a DNN regression with a conditionally\nGaussian prior for the final layer weights\, from which an implicit copula\nprocess on the feature space is extracted. This copula process is combined\nwith a non-parametrically estimated marginal distribution for the response.\nThe end result is a scalable distributional DNN regression method with\nmarginally calibrated predictions\, and our work complements existing methods\nfor probability calibration. The approach is first illustrated using two\napplications of dense layer feed-forward neural networks. However\, our main\nmotivating applications are in likelihood-free inference\, where\ndistributional deep regression is used to estimate marginal posterior\ndistributions. In two complex ecological time series examples we employ the\nimplicit copulas of convolutional networks\, and show that marginal\ncalibration results in improved uncertainty quantification. Our approach\nalso avoids the need for manual specification of summary statistics\, a\nrequirement that is burdensome for users and typical of competing\nlikelihood-free inference methods.

We study this possibility using college choices of southern-Italian students classified as Civic if not cheating in a die-roll experiment. Local civicness is the fraction of Civic in their high-school class. A civicness drain is observed at high and low local civicness. We explain this finding in a model in which Civic and Uncivic types balance hope vs. fear of migration outcomes\, taking into account economic gains\, risk preferences\, and their beliefs about being considered Civic in the place of destination.

DESCRIPTION:<b>Title:</b> Structural varying-coefficient regression to identify brain regions affecting motor impairment in Huntington disease<br><b><br>Abstract:</b> Structural varying-coefficient regression models are important in many fields\, from finance and economics to biology and medicine. In clinical studies\, prediction models are often essential for forecasting and monitoring the progression of a disease. Developing prediction models is a challenge when dealing with high-dimensional data since we do not know which variables are related to the response variable of interest and this relationship may depend on other continuous or categorical modifying variables as well. We formalize this problem as the varying-coefficient model selection and propose a novel variable selection method\, svReg\, that accounts for both continuous and categorical modifying variables. <br><br>Our contributions are three-fold:<br>1. The svReg method is shown to better screen irrelevant variables over the existing method that ignores the group structure of categorical modifying variables and to lead to a prediction model with higher accuracy and easier interpretation. <br>2. Our method adequately considers the pre-specified group structure among modifying variables in addition to unstructured modifying variables. <br>3. The svReg approach is empirically shown to perform better than existing methods such as the Lasso and pLasso even when there is no categorical modifying variable or any pre-specified group structure among modifying variables. <br><br>Using simulation studies\, we show our method selects less irrelevant variables compared to existing methods while choosing relevant variables correctly. This provides us with a prediction model with higher specificity\, lower false discovery rate and lower mean squared error. <br><br>The proposed methodology is motivated by and illustrated using data from a Huntington disease study\; the result identifies brain regions associated with motor impairment accounting for differentiated relationship by disease severity. To the best of our knowledge\, our study is the first to identify the interaction effect between disease severity and the volume of brain regions in a varying-coefficient model framework.<br><br>This is joint work with Rakheon Kim and Tanya Garcia\, both at Texas A&amp\;M\, Department of Statistics.&nbsp\;&nbsp\;

Cointegration\, representation\, and statistical inference is discussed in the MFCVAR model\, and the relevant asymptotic theory is derived. The notion of cointegration connectedness of a group of variables is defined\, and it is found that the maximum likelihood estimators of contrasts between the fractional orders of connected variables are superconsistent\, leading to asymptotically mixed Gaussian inference. The remaining estimators and test statistics retain their asymptotic properties from the more standard FCVAR model.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Bayesian Inference for Regression Copulas\n\n\nAbstract: We propose a new semiparametric distributional regression smoother that is based on a copula decomposition of the joint distribution of the vector of response values. The copula is high-dimensional and constructed by inversion of a pseudo regression\, where the conditional mean and variance are semiparametric functions of covariates modeled using regularized basis functions. By integrating out the basis coefficients\, an implicit copula process on the covariate space is obtained\, which we call a “regression copula.” We combine this with a nonparametric margin to define a copula model\, where the entire distribution— including the mean and variance—of the response is a smooth semiparametric function of the covariates. The copula is estimated using both Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and variational Bayes\; the latter of which is scalable to high dimensions. Using real data examples and a simulation study\, we illustrate the efficacy of these estimators and the copula model. In a substantive example\, we estimate the distribution of half-hourly electricity spot prices as a function of demand and two time covariates using radial bases and horseshoe regularization. The copula model produces distributional estimates that are locally adaptive with respect to the covariates\, and predictions that are more accurate than those from benchmark models.

In this paper\, we develop composite likelihood methods for large VARs with multivariate stochastic volatility. These involve estimating large numbers of parsimonious models and then taking a weighted average across these models. We discuss various schemes for choosing the weights. In our empirical work involving VARs of up to 196 variables\, we show that composite likelihood methods forecast much better than the most popular large VAR approach which is computationally practical in very high dimensions: the homoskedastic VAR with Minnesota prior. We also compare our methods to various popular approaches which allow for stochastic volatility using medium and small VARs involving up to 20 variables. We find our methods to forecast appreciably better than these as well.</p>Details of the seminar can be found in the calendar and via the following link:<br><a href="[signup link removed]">[signup link removed]>&nbsp\;&nbsp\;

Our formula additionally corrects for the over-identification bias in variance estimation on top of the commonly used finite sample correction of Windmeijer (2005) which corrects for the bias from estimating the efficient weight matrix\, so is doubly corrected. An important feature of the proposed double correction is that it automatically provides robustness to misspecification of the moment condition. In contrast\, the conventional variance estimator and the Windmeijer correction are inconsistent under misspecification. That is\, the proposed double correction formula provides a convenient way to obtain improved inference under correct specification and robustness against misspecification at the same time.

The existing inference methods such as the plug-in principle and the projection approach have low power when the unrestricted parameters are weakly identified. We propose a rotation of the parameter space which eliminates the unidentified components of the nuisance parameter vector and preserves the identified ones. As such\, inference for the subset hypothesis of interest can be drawn uniformly using the conventional plug-in method in the transformed model. We then use this result to propose the score\, Lagrange multiplier\, and conditional likelihood ratio tests for the subvector hypothesis considered. We show that these tests have correct asymptotic size over a large class of data distributions\, including heteroskedastic or weakly dependent data generating processes. The proposed tests are also asymptotically similar and unbiased\, thus offering a significant improvement upon existing methods that often deliver uniform size control.

However\, there is evidence questioning its test-retest reliability\, with up to 30% of individuals changing their response. Building on recent advances in the econometrics of misclassification\, we develop ways of obtaining consistent estimates despite misclassification in reported SAH using data from a large representative household survey where SAH was elicited twice\, to gain new insights into the nature of SAH misclassification and its potential for biasing health econometric estimates. The results from applying our approach to nonlinear models of long-term mortality and chronic morbidities reveal that there is substantial heterogeneity in misclassification patterns. We find that adjusting for misclassification is important for estimating the impact of SAH. For other variables of interest\, we find significant but generally small changes to their estimates when misclassification is ignored.

Application to Crashworthiness Ratings' Format\, with Siqi Liu and Benjamin Shiller<br><b></b><br><b>Abstract: </b><br>Many ratings organizations intentionally coarsen ratings before public presentation\, for example using a discrete badge rather than a continuous rating. We investigate the impact of coarsening empirically in the context of automobile crashworthiness ratings. Specifically\, we estimate a random coefficient model of demand for safety under status quo coarse ratings\, then simulate the outcomes under a counterfactual scenario with a novel continuous crashworthiness rating system. We find the finer crashworthiness ratings would alter consumer vehicle choices and thereby reduce fatalities by about 1.5%. A back of the envelope calculation implies continuous ratings would reduce fatalities in the United States by 375 annually. We then explore whether reduced incentives to provide crashworthy vehicles under a continuous rating scheme might offset these benefits. We find that the requisite manufacturer response is implausibly large. We conclude that a continuous rating scheme would save lives.

Evidence from the COVID-19 pandemic<br><b></b><br><b>Abstract: </b>Market-wide circuit breakers (MWCBs)\, which halt trading for 15 minutes across all U.S. stock markets\, have been triggered four times in March 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper provides some of the first evidence on the efficacy of MWCBs with tick-by-tick stock trading data. Using a difference-in-differences approach\, we find that although MWCBs boost stocks’ trading volume\, they significantly increase stocks’ realized volatility and bid-ask spread. Moreover\, the market opening and reopening mechanisms&nbsp\; of different stock exchanges complicate the operation of MWCBs. Our results suggest that MWCBs can have the unintended consequences of panicking the markets for a prolonged period of time\, especially by aggravating market volatility and liquidity conditions.&nbsp\;<br><b><br></b>

Instead of identifying structural shocks in a vector autoregressive model\, we search for clusters of recurrent patterns of observations resembling given initial conditions or any hypothetical scenario before and after a shock hits. By comparing the dynamics of the variables of interest in these two situations\, we are able to trace out the effects of the shock. In an empirical application to U.S. fiscal policy\, we show that the government spending multiplier is moderate\, typically clearly smaller than one\, and at most only weakly dependent on initial macroeconomic conditions\, including the phase of the business cycle.

This is particularly important in case of fiscal policy\, since economic agents receive clear signals\, or news\, about future changes in legislation.&nbsp\; Several authors have constructed measures to capture policy news which economic agents receive at a given point in time.&nbsp\; Such narrative measures are often based on information contained in text-based resources\, e.g. newspapers.&nbsp\; In such&nbsp\; a&nbsp\; way\,&nbsp\; tax&nbsp\; shocks&nbsp\; have&nbsp\; been&nbsp\; constructed&nbsp\; in&nbsp\; an&nbsp\; ex-post&nbsp\; manner&nbsp\; for&nbsp\; all&nbsp\; major&nbsp\; changes&nbsp\; in post-war U.S. tax legislation (cf.

It extends the proposed score and defines a weighted version\, which emphasizes regions of interest\, such as the tails or the center of a variable's range. A test is also introduced to statistically compare the predictive ability of different forecasts. The ACPS is of general use in any situation where the decision maker has asymmetric preferences in the evaluation of the forecasts. In an artificial experiment\, the implications of varying the level of asymmetry in the ACPS are illustrated. Then\, the proposed score and test are applied to assess and compare density forecasts of macroeconomic relevant datasets (US employment growth) and of commodity prices (oil and electricity prices) with particular focus on the recent COVID-19 crisis period.&nbsp\;&nbsp\;<br></p>

Recent studies provide evidence from quasi-experiments\, but disagree even on the sign of (local average) wage effects. We re-visit the regression discontinuity design of Schmieder et al. (2016)\, but use more detailed data and a wage decomposition to re-analyze the effects of PBD in a framework that allows for unrestricted heterogeneity of both duration and wage effects. Our (preliminary) results indicate treatment effect heterogeneity that casts doubt on simple mechanisms and complicates learning from (local) average effects. Specifically\, we first show that duration effects are heterogeneous\, which confirms that treatment changes dynamic selection. Our results so far suggest that PBD almost exclusively prolongs unemployment spells ending close to exhaustion points. We examine pre-determined wage components to (partly) separate dynamic selection from dynamic treatment effects. Dynamic selection is potentially non-monotonic and may create spurious treatment effects in our sample. We find that PBD affects wages only through the firm fixed effect\, which adds to evidence on the importance of firms. It suggests that wage losses are likely due to firm attributes (such as bargaining power) rather than individual attributes (such as productivity). Purging (parts of) dynamic selection from re-employment wages shows that the steep wage decline is mainly driven by the firm fixed effect\, but also by time-varying unobservables. The marked exhaustion effects have at most a small impact on the effect of PBD on wages. Wage effects appear to accumulate through employment at lower-paying firms at short unemployment durations. Our current results are work in progress\, but demonstrate that heterogeneity in both duration and wage effects alters the interpretation of common analyses and thereby potentially reconciles diverging findings. We develop tools to make progress on important questions in the presence of essential heterogeneity.

Under a general high-dimensional setting where both dimension p and sample size T go to infinity and p/T converges to c &gt\; 0\, we consider high-dimensional time series to follow a factor model where both the temporal and cross-sectional dependence are assumed to be captured by a number off actors. The limiting normal distributions for spiked eigenvalues of high-dimensional sample auto-covariance matrices are established for both cases with either fixed or diverging lags of auto-covariance. Additionally\, as a statistical application of the CLT\, a novel auto-covariance test is proposed based on the difference between spiked eigenvalues of sample auto-covariance matrices for two high-dimensional time series. This auto-covariance test provides statistical inferences for comparing the spectral properties of two high-dimensional time series and facilitates further statistical applications such as clustering on multiple population high-dimensional time series.

Our bounds are applicable if the conditioning variables do not satisfy the overlap condition\, are high-dimensional\, and take on a large number of different values in the observed sample. This robustness is achieved by only using limited ``pooling'' of information across observations. Namely\, the bounds are constructed as sample averages over functions of the observed outcomes such that the contribution of each outcome only depends on the treatment status of a limited number of observations. No information pooling across observations leads to so-called ``Manski bounds''\, while unlimited information pooling leads to standard inverse propensity score weighting.

In this paper\, we develop methods for combining the two using a subspace shrinkage prior. Subspace priors shrink towards a class of functions rather than directly forcing the parameters of a model towards some pre-specified location. We develop a conjugate VAR prior which shrinks towards the subspace which is defined by a factor model. Our approach allows for estimating the strength of the shrinkage as well as the number of factors. After establishing the theoretical properties of our proposed prior\, we carry out simulations and apply it to US macroeconomic data. Using simulations we show that our framework successfully detects the number of factors. In a forecasting exercise involving a large macroeconomic data set we find that combining VARs with factor models using our prior can lead to forecast improvements.</p><p><b>arxiv link:&nbsp\;</b><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07804">https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07804</a></p><p><u><br></u></p><p>This is a one-hour seminar\, with 45 minutes for the presentation and 15 minutes at the end for questions.</p><p>More information about the online seminars\, including upcoming speakers\, can be found in the link below</p><p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/9owmr6blkdr5m01/Seminar%20speakers%202021.docx?dl=0">https://www.dropbox.com/s/<u></u>9owmr6blkdr5m01/Seminar%<u></u>20speakers%202021.docx?dl=0</a>&nbsp\;</p><p>You are receiving this email because you previously attended or expressed an interest in the seminar series.

This is generally regarded as consisting of three components. The names assigned to these vary from one discipline to another\, but in actuarial science\, they are known as parameter\, process and model errors. The first two of these components\, and their estimation\, are well understood but less so model error.</p><p>Model error itself is considered in two parts: one part that is capable of estimation from past data (internal model error (“IME”))\, and another part that is not (external model error). Attention is focused here on IME. Estimation of IME is approached by means of Bayesian model averaging (“BMA”)\, where the</p><p>population of models to be averaged\, and their prior probabilities\, are obtained from a LASSO model. The population of models entering into the BMA may turn out to be “thinner” than desired\, and bootstrapping of the LASSO is used to gain bulk. A few intensely practical issues arise in this process\,</p><p>and they are discussed. The majority of the discussion applies to forecasting generally\, but numerical illustration of the concepts is given in relation to insurance data and the problem of insurance loss reserving.</p>This is a one-hour seminar\, with 50 minutes for the presentation and 10 minutes at the end for questions.<br><br>More information about the seminar series\, including upcoming speakers\, can be found&nbsp\;<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/wqr5fli6czluzef/EBS%20Seminar%20speakers%202022.docx?dl=0"><u><u><u><u><u><u><u>here</u></u></u></u></u></u></u></a>.&nbsp\;<br><br><u></u>Past seminar recordings can be found&nbsp\;<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/u4nhhfki80xyvwl/AABqo9Bwq5iVPLAFDZD5teNJa?dl=0"><u><u><u><u><u><u>here</u></u></u></u></u></u></a>.&nbsp\;<br><br>You are receiving this email because you previously attended or expressed an interest in the seminar series.

We use a novel set of linked whole of-population administrativerecords to examine more than half-a-million Australians who found themselvesnewly on an unemployment payment in the initial months of the COVID-19pandemic. We estimate that receiving a lump sum of up to A$10\,000 fromsuperannuation accounts at the most acute phase of the pandemic\, between Apriland June 2020\, resulted in a 32 per cent lower exit rate from unemploymentbenefits inside the first six months of a spell on benefits\, and 14 per centinside a year of spell. Receiving a lump sum during the second window ofopportunity – mostly in July and August 2020 and as a labour market recoverywas underway – resulted in a 34 per cent lower exit from unemployment benefitsinside the first nine months of spell\, and 14 per cent inside fifteen months ofspell. The jobseeking deterrence is ultimately temporary but it took close toeighteen months for an estimated convergence between withdrawers and those thatdidn’t withdraw. 162\,000 withdrawers with completed spells on average spent anadditional 7 weeks on unemployment payments\, translating to 8 millionadditional days in aggregate\, and implying A$580 million in additional pandemicfiscal expenditure.</p><b>Speaker Bio</b>:<i>&nbsp\;</i>Robert Breunig is the director of the&nbsp\;<a href="https://taxpolicy.crawford.anu.edu.au/">Tax and Transfer Policy Institute</a>&nbsp\;at the Crawford School of Public Policy.

However\, impulse responses to a unit shock – a shock that raises a particular variable by one unit – are often more relevant\, particularly for policy analysis. For example\, central bankers are interested in answering questions like ‘what are the effects of a 100&nbsp\;basis point increase in the federal funds rate?’ This paper explores the extent to which set-identifying restrictions are informative about impulse responses to unit shocks. I show that identified sets for these impulse responses may be unbounded and discuss issues that this raises for conducting inference. I explain how to draw useful inferences about impulse responses even when the identified sets for these impulse responses are unbounded at some values of the reduced-form parameters. I illustrate the empirical relevance of these issues by estimating the macroeconomic effects of a 100&nbsp\;basis point shock to the federal funds rate. The results obtained under a rich set of identifying restrictions are broadly consistent with the output effects of US monetary policy lying towards the smaller end of the range of existing estimates.</p><p><b>&nbsp\;</b></p></td></tr></tbody></table>More information about the seminar series\, including upcoming speakers\, can be found&nbsp\;<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/wqr5fli6czluzef/EBS%20Seminar%20speakers%202022.docx?dl=0"><u><u><u><u><u><u>here</u></u></u></u></u></u></a>.&nbsp\;<br><br><u></u>Past seminar recordings can be found&nbsp\;<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/u4nhhfki80xyvwl/AABqo9Bwq5iVPLAFDZD5teNJa?dl=0"><u><u><u><u><u>here</u></u></u></u></u></a>.&nbsp\;<br><br>You are receiving this email because you previously attended or expressed an interest in the seminar series.

Focus is on censored density forecasts that quantify forecast risks in a middle region of the density covering a specified probability\, and ignore the magnitude but not the frequency of outlying observations. We propose a fixed-point algorithm that fits a potentially skewed and fat-tailed density to the inner observations\, acknowledging that the outlying observations may be drawn from a different but unknown distribution.&nbsp\; We also introduce a new test for calibration of censored density forecasts. An application using historical forecast errors from the Federal Reserve Board and the Monetary Policy Committee at the Bank of England suggests that the use of censored density functions to represent the pattern of forecast errors results in much greater parameter stability than do uncensored densities. We illustrate the utility of censored density forecasts when quantifying forecast risks after shocks such as the global financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic and find that\, for the United Kingdom\, these outperform the official forecasts produced by the MPC.<b></b></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table>More information about the seminar series\, including upcoming speakers\, can be found&nbsp\;<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/wqr5fli6czluzef/EBS%20Seminar%20speakers%202022.docx?dl=0"><u><u><u><u><u><u>here</u></u></u></u></u></u></a>.&nbsp\;<br><br><u></u>Past seminar recordings can be found&nbsp\;<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/u4nhhfki80xyvwl/AABqo9Bwq5iVPLAFDZD5teNJa?dl=0"><u><u><u><u><u>here</u></u></u></u></u></a>.&nbsp\;<br><br>You are receiving this email because you previously attended or expressed an interest in the seminar series.

However\, when justifying DiD\, researchers often argue that the treatment is “quasi-randomly” assigned. We investigate what selection mechanisms are compatible with the parallel trends assumptions underlying DiD. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for parallel trends that clarify whether and how selection can depend on time-invariant and time-varying unobservables. We also suggest a menu of interpretable primitive sufficient conditions for parallel trends\, thereby providing the formal underpinnings for justifying DiD based on contextual information about selection into treatment. We provider esults for both separable and nonseparable outcome models and show that this distinction has implications for the use of covariates in DiD analyses. Building on our analysis of nonseparable models\, we connect DiD to the literature on nonparametric identification in panel models.</p><b>Speaker Bio</b>:<i>&nbsp\;</i>Kaspar is an Associate Professor at the Department of Economics at UC San Diego.

That is\, data which are spatially and/or temporally indexed\, and consists of multiple (usually) discrete responses characterized by a strong mean-variance relationship. Such data can arise in a number of disciplines\, with a prime example being in ecology where long running surveys collect data on species communities to understand their spatio-temporal evolution and how they are/will respond to a changing climate. The most commonly used approach for analyzing spatio-temporal multivariate abundance data is using some flavor of spatio-temporal latent variable models (LVMs)\, although known as spatio-temporal factor analytic models. However\, while methodological and computational advances continue to be made with LVMs\, their application to spatio-temporal multivariate abundance data remains computationally burdensome and not necessarily scalable when it comes to model fitting and inference.</p><p>&nbsp\;In this talk\, we propose an alternative approach to spatio-temporal multivariate modeling which breaks away from the LVM framework. Inspired by the concept of fixed rank kriging\, we employ a set of common fixed spatial and/or temporal basis functions\, with corresponding response-specific random slopes to account for spatio-temporal correlations both within and</p><p>between responses. The resulting community-level basis function model (CBFM) can be used for the same array of purposes as spatio-temporal LVMs\, but is designed to be computationally much more efficient given they can be set up and fitted using the same machinery as for generalized additive models. Simulations and an application to a demersals fish dataset collected off the Northeast US continental shelf illustrate the potential of CBFMs for scalable spatio-temporal multivariate modelling.</p><p><b>&nbsp\;</b>More information about the seminar series\, including upcoming speakers\, can be found&nbsp\;<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/wqr5fli6czluzef/EBS%20Seminar%20speakers%202022.docx?dl=0"><u><u><u><u><u><u>here</u></u></u></u></u></u></a>.&nbsp\;</p></td></tr></tbody></table><br><u></u>Past seminar recordings can be found&nbsp\;<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/u4nhhfki80xyvwl/AABqo9Bwq5iVPLAFDZD5teNJa?dl=0"><u><u><u><u><u>here</u></u></u></u></u></a>.&nbsp\;<br><br>You are receiving this email because you previously attended or expressed an interest in the seminar series.

Two highly popular configurations are shown to be asymptotically observationally equivalent: one with long memory and weak autoregressive dynamics\, the other with antipersistent shocks and a near-unit autoregressive root. We develop a data-driven semiparametric and identification-robust approach to inference that reveals such ambiguities and documents the prevalence of weak identification in many realized volatility and trading volume series. The identification-robust empirical evidence generally favors long memory dynamics in volatility and volume\, a conclusion that is corroborated using social-media news flow data.</p><p><b>Speaker Bio</b>:<i>&nbsp\;</i>Shuping Shi is a Professor at Macquarie University.

Wefind a large range of hospital-level effects relating to the use of a cascadeof interventions and contextualise our findings in the discourse on hospitalpractice styles\, which in relation to maternity care posits that a lessinterventionist style committed to natural birth is possible and in contrast toa more medicalised and interventionist style.</p><p><b>Speaker Bio</b>:<i>&nbsp\;</i>Denzil is a Professor in the School of Economics\, UNSW Business School and previously held a chair&nbsp\;in econometrics at the University of Sydney.&nbsp\;He has served terms as discipline head and member of&nbsp\;Academic Board at both universities.&nbsp\;He was a member of the Australian Research Council College of&nbsp\;Experts 2014-17\, President of AHES 2005-10\, on the Executive Board of iHEA 2014-17\, chaired the&nbsp\;iHEA Scientific Committee 2016-19 and is on the Scientific Committee of the Asian Workshop on&nbsp\;Econometrics and Health Economics.

We show that misclassification in D hampers consistent estimation of ATT because 1) it restricts us from identifying the truly treated from those misclassified as being treated and 2) differential misclassification in counterfactual trends may result in parallel trends being violated with D even when they hold with the true but unobserved D*. We propose a solution to correct for endogenous one-sided misclassification in the context of a parametric DID regression which allows for considerable heterogeneity in treatment effects and establish its asymptotic properties in panel and repeated cross section settings. Furthermore\, we illustrate the method by using it to estimate the insurance impact of a large-scale in-kind food transfer program in India which is known to suffer from large targeting errors."&nbsp\;</p></html-blob>

Under a parallel trends assumption\, we show that the coefficient on each treatment identifies the sum of two terms. The first term is a weighted sum of the effect of that treatment in each group and period\, with weights that may be negative and sum to one. The second term is a sum of the effects of the other treatments\, with weights summing to zero. Therefore\, those coefficients are not robust to heterogeneous effects and may be contaminated by other treatments’ effects. We propose an alternative difference-in-differences estimator\, robust to heterogeneous effects and immune to the contamination problem. To estimate\, say\, the first treatment’s effect\, our estimator compares the outcome evolution of a group whose first treatment changes while its other treatments remain unchanged\, to control groups whose treatments all remain unchanged\, and with the same baseline treatments as the switching group.</p><b>Speaker Bio</b>:<i>&nbsp\;</i>Clément de Chaisemartin is a Professor in the Department of Economics at Sciences Po since 2021.

With this novel empirical approach\, we are able to analyze the effects of various shocks to the income distribution on macro aggregates as well as the effects of macroeconomic shocks on the income distribution. Main findings are as follows. First\, contractionary monetary policy shocks improve income inequality\, when we focus on the re-distributive effect beyond the negative aggregate level effect\, by reducing the number of low and high income people while increasing the number of middle income people\; however\, contractionary monetary policy shocks worsen income inequality when the aggregate income shift is taken into account.

However\, existing algorithms used to generateconditional forecasts can be computationally intensive\, especially whenmultiple simultaneous soft and hard constraints are imposed. To overcome thiscomputational challenge\, we propose a novel precision based conditionalforecast sampler that allows us to generate draws of the conditional forecastsfrom a hard or soft constraint in a fast and efficient manner. We show in asimulation study that our proposed method produces identical conditionalforecasts as in the Waggoner and Zha (1999) algorithm but in a computationallymore efficient manner. We illustrate our proposed method in a large BVAR modeland impose three simultaneous soft constraints that mimic the current economicsituation in the US.<br>This is a one-hour seminar\, with 50 minutes for the presentation and 10 minutes at the end for questions.<br><br>More information about the seminar series\, including upcoming speakers\, can be found&nbsp\;<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/wqr5fli6czluzef/EBS%20Seminar%20speakers%202022.docx?dl=0"><u><u><u><u><u><u>here</u></u></u></u></u></u></a>.&nbsp\;<br><br><u></u>Past seminar recordings can be found&nbsp\;<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/u4nhhfki80xyvwl/AABqo9Bwq5iVPLAFDZD5teNJa?dl=0"><u><u><u><u><u>here</u></u></u></u></u></a>.&nbsp\;<br><br>You are receiving this email because you previously attended or expressed an interest in the seminar series.

To disentangle and quantify their respective importance\, we identify country-specific structural monetary policy\, demand\, and supply equations in a Bayesian structural panel vector autoregressive model. We formulate prior beliefs on magnitudes and signs of contemporaneous structural coefficients (i.e.\, (semi-)elasticities)\, based on a standard theoretical multi-country open economy model from the literature. Our findings show that interest rate spillovers occur via an aggregated demand channel. Unexpected monetary tightening causes modest declines in most foreign interest rates\, while demand and supply shocks result in increased foreign interest rates. Our results support that central banks respond to changes in the domestic macroeconomic environment induced by domestic or foreign shocks rather than directly reacting to foreign shocks. Spillovers are quantitatively stronger for shocks originating in economically large areas with strong trade linkages.</span><br></p><p><span>The working paper is available </span><a href="https://www.iwh-halle.de/fileadmin/user_upload/publications/iwh_discussion_papers/iwh-discussion-paper_2023_03_Camehl_Schweinitz.pdf">here</a>.<br></p><p><b>Speaker Bio</b>:<i> </i>Annika Camehl is an Assistant Professor at Erasmus University Rotterdam.

When individuals are classified\, the decision errors can be unfairly concentrated in certain protected groups. We develop a fairness-adjusted selective inference (FASI) framework and data-driven algorithms that achieve statistical parity in the sense that the false selection rate (FSR) is controlled and equalized among protected groups. The FASI algorithm operates by converting the outputs from black-box classifiers to R-values\, which are intuitively appealing and easy to compute. Selection rules based on R-values are provably valid for FSR control\, and avoid disparate impacts on protected groups. The effectiveness of FASI is demonstrated through both simulated and real data.</p><p>The working paper is available here: <a href="https://bradleyrava.github.io/Papers/fasi.pdf">https://bradleyrava.github.io/Papers/fasi.pdf</a></p><p><b>Speaker’s Bio</b>: I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Business Analytics at the University of Sydney's Business School.

The concern here is with a situation in which sample size can be far exceeded by the dimensions of both the vector of regression function parameters and the associated instrumental variable-based estimating equations. We propose a new model averaging approach based on generalized empirical likelihood as an approximation to the average structural function in this circumstance which\, unlike many studies\, does not require a sparsity assumption on the true data generating process structural function parameters. We show that our procedure has an asymptotic optimality property in the sense of achieving the smallest possible loss with respect to a generalised empirical likelihood loss function. A study of the large sample properties of the generalized empirical likelihood estimator under misspecification is needed to establish the optimality result and\, as a result\, a different strategy to that elsewhere must be deployed in the proof. The paper provides results from a set of simulation experiments which illustrate the efficacy of the model-averaging procedure together with an a application to credit card use for taxi fare payment pre- and post Covid in the New York metropolitan area.<br></p><p><b>Speaker Bio</b><span>:</span><i> </i><span>Richard Smith is a Professor (Emeritus) at the Faculty of Economics\, University of Cambridge.

With the rapid growth of wind power capacity due </span><span>to efforts to reduce carbon emissions\, the demand for wind derivatives to manage </span><span>uncertainty in wind power production is expected to increase. However\, existing </span><span>wind derivative literature often assumes normally distributed wind speed\, despite </span><span>the presence of skewness and leptokurtosis in historical wind speed data. This </span><span>paper investigates how the mis-specification of wind speed models affects wind </span><span>derivative prices and proposes the use of the generalized hyperbolic distribution </span><span>to allow for non-normality. The study develops risk-neutral approaches for pricing </span><span>wind derivatives using the conditional Esscher transform\, which can accommodate </span><span>stochastic processes with any distribution. The analysis demonstrates that model </span><span>risk differs depending on the choice of the underlying index and the derivative’s </span><span>payoff structure. Therefore\, caution should be exercised when choosing wind speed </span><span>models\, and model risk cannot be ignored in pricing wind speed derivatives.</span></p><p><b>Speaker Bio</b>:<i> </i><span>Rui Zhou holds a Ph.D. degree in Actuarial Science from the University of Waterloo and is a Fellow of the Society of Actuaries (FSA) and an Associate of the Canadian Institute of Actuaries (ACIA).

We consider this problem in the setting of the censored and kinked structural VAR (CKSVAR)\, which provides a flexible yet tractable framework within which to model time series that are subject to threshold-type nonlinearities\, such as those arising due to occasionally binding constraints\, of which the zero lower bound (ZLB) on short-term nominal interest rates provides a leading example. We provide a complete characterisation of how common linear and nonlinear stochastic trends may be generated in this model\, via unit roots and appropriate generalisations of the usual rank conditions\, providing the first extension to date of the Granger-Johansen representation theorem from a linear to a nonlinear setting\, and thereby giving the first successful treatment of the open problem. The limiting common trend processes include regulated\, censored and kinked Brownian motions\, none of which have previously appeared in the literature on cointegrated VARs. Our results and running examples illustrate that the CKSVAR is capable of supporting a far richer variety of long-run behaviour than is a linear VAR\, in ways that may be particularly useful for the identification of structural parameters. En route to establishing our main results\, we also develop a set of sufficient conditions for the processes generated by a CKSVAR to be stationary\, ergodic\, and weakly dependent.<br></p><p>The paper is available at: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09604">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09604</a><br></p><p><b>Speaker Bio</b>:<i> </i>James Duffy is an Associate Professor in Economics and a Andrew Glyn Fellow at Corpus Christi College\, University of Oxford.

Several centrality indices that capturecomplementary aspects of a node's position have been proposed in the literature over the years. One of the most popular among them is <b>degree centrality</b>. Informally\, <b>degree centrality</b> of a node is the number of nodes adjacent to it.</p><p>Despite its simplicity\, degree centrality can be very revealing. It measures the immediate reachability of a node. In other words\, a node's importance depends on how many other nodes can be reached directly from it. For example\, in a typical social network\, where each node corresponds to an actor\, and an edge between two nodes indicates social interaction\, degree centrality captures the size of the social circle of an actor. In sensor and facility location applications\, degree centrality captures the number of instantaneously reachable or covered nodes.</p><p>In this talk\, we extend the concept of node centrality to centrality of a path in a graph. We focus on degree centrality<b> of the shortest path</b> between two nodes. We show that the number of shortest paths between two nodes can be exponential in the worst case. Nevertheless\, we can find the most degree-central shortest path in polynomial time. We develop efficient algorithms to solve the unweighted and weighted versions of the most degree-central shortest path problem. We discuss algorithm implementations and numerical results.</p><p><b>Speaker Bio</b>:  Dmytro Matsypura is an Associate Professor and the Head of the Discipline of Business Analytics at the University of Sydney Business School.

We also assess their impact on bond market functioning. The measures were purchases to support government bond market function over early 2020\, the yield target on 3-year Australian government bonds\, and the bond purchase programme to lower longer-term yields from late 2020 through early 2022. For purchases to support market function\, we find that the announcement lowered short-dated Australian Government Securities (AGS) yields but did not lower longer-dated AGS yields. We also find that purchases led to lower yields as and when they were implemented and that they supported market function by lowering bid–offer spreads. For the yield target\, we find a substantial announcement effect and moderate implementation effects on yields. Conversely\, the yield target appears to have detrimentally affected some aspects of the bond market function. For the bond purchase programme\, we find an announcement effect of approximately 30 basis points for longer-term AGS yields\; however\, any implementation effects were small and temporary.</p><p>The paper can be found <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1475-4932.12734?saml_referrer"><u><u><u><u><u><u><u>here</u></u></u></u></u></u></u></a>.<br></p><p><b>Speaker Bio</b>:<i> </i>Dr Richard Finlay currently works in the Domestic Markets dealing room at the Reserve Bank of Australia.

How do we teach it in a way that lends itself to iteration as the landscape of data science evolves and scales to more students and more instructors? In this talk I will aim to accomplish two goals to answer these questions: (1) Introduce a semester-long\, modern introductory data science curriculum\, along with its design philosophy\, implementation details (particularly as class sizes increase)\, technical infrastructure\, and real examples from course content as well as from student projects. (2) Discuss how I've open-sourced this curriculum at <a href="http://datasciencebox.org/">datasciencebox.org</a> for sharing with and re-use/adaptation by other instructors and what it takes to maintain this open-source project as the landscape of data science\, data science education curriculum guidelines\, and data science tooling evolves.</i><p><b>Speaker Bio</b>:  Professor Mine Cetinkaya-Rundelis a Professor of Practice and the Director of Undergraduate Studies at the Department of Statistical Science and an affiliated faculty in the Computational Media\, Arts\, and Cultures program at Duke University.

We propose a methodology that can be applied </span><span>to critical illness and life insurance underwriting to quantify the impact of such delays on </span><span>breast cancer mortality. We introduce a semi-Markov model based on publicly available </span><span>population data for women in England and on relevant medical literature. Our modelling </span><span>approach also extends an insurance industry-based multiple state model\, by incorporating </span><span>events related to cancer diagnosis\, progression and undiagnosed cases. We quantify age-</span><span>specific excess deaths\, for a period up to 5 years\, along with years of life expectancy </span><span>lost and changes in cancer mortality by cancer stage. Our analysis suggests a 3–6% </span><span>increase in breast cancer deaths\, and a 4–6% increase in registrations of advanced breast </span><span>cancer for women aged 65–89. Our approach exhibits consistent results in sensitivity </span><span>analyses\, providing a model that can account for changes in breast cancer diagnostic and </span><span>treatment services. We then obtain actuarial fair premiums for a specialised critical illness </span><span>and life insurance product for women aged 30–60. Our analysis shows that the semi-</span><span>Markov model leads to results aligned with the empirical evidence. Our findings point </span><span>out the importance of accounting for the time spent with a diagnosed or undiagnosed </span><span>pre-metastatic breast cancer in actuarial applications.</span></p><p><b>Speaker Bio</b>:<i> </i><span>Ayse is a research fellow in Department of Actuarial Mathematics and Statistics\, Heriot-Watt University (HWU)\, UK since December 2020.

Among popular DRMs are transformation models\, which have received renewed interest in the statistics and machine learning literature. Transformation models aim at estimating the entire conditional cumulative distribution function (cCDF). Conditional transformation models (CTMs) allow the cCDF to depend on the covariates in a flexible way through a so-called conditional transformation function h(·|x) ≡ h(·|X = x). Importantly\, CTMs shift the focus towards estimating the conditional transformation function h(·|x) in such a way that the transformed response h(Y|x) follows a statistically convenient\, fully specified target distribution which is independent of the covariates. This leads to flexible and broadly applicable yet interpretable regression models which implicitly estimate the entire cCDF.  This talk shows how to extend univariate CTMs to multivariate responses. We focus on the likelihood-based approach and outline current research on a Bayesian counterpart. The latter have recently been introduced for univariate CTMs (BCTMs) as a B-spline based Bayesian version of most likely transformation models. In contrast to their likelihood-based counterparts\, BCTMs also allow for exact inference on functions of the estimated cCDF in small-sample settings and control the smoothness of estimated effects via penalizing priors</p><p><b>Speaker Bio</b><span>:</span><i> </i><span>Prof. Nadja Klein earned her doctorate in Mathematics from the University of Göttingen in 2015.

The refined version of assortment optimization takes a more subtle approach to improve profits. This is done by selectively making some products less appealing\, thereby steering demand to more profitable products. Examples include but are not limited to offering longer delivery times\, insisting on advanced purchases\, imposing waiting lists\, and lowering product transparency. Refined assortment optimization can significantly improve expected profits relative to traditional assortment optimization. For the latent-class MNL\, the ratio can be as high as the number of products or the number of market segments\, whichever is smaller. As the refined assortment optimization is intractable\, we focus on the development of heuristics. We show the revenue-ordered heuristic has the same performance guarantee relative to the</span><span> </span><span>personalized</span><span> </span><span>refined assortment optimization problem as it does relative to the traditional</span><span> </span><span>non- personalized</span><span> </span><span>assortment optimization problem. Based on this finding\, we construct revenue-ordered based heuristics for the refined assortment problem. In our experiments for the latent-class MNL our heuristics yield expected revenues that are often higher than the optimal expected revenues for the traditional assortment optimization problem. In extensive numerical studies our heuristics outperform the ADXOPT algorithm adapted to refined assortments\, and a general-purpose non-linear optimizer.</span><span> </span></p><p><b>Speaker Bio</b>:  <span>Gerardo has a PhD in Operations Research from the Université de Montréal\, and a Master in Computer Science from the University of Buenos Aires.

Despite their popularity\, such models may unavoidably be affected by the misspecification issue given that it is likely that the underlying distribution will be different from that assumed. In this paper\, we incorporate monotone splines to ensure the expected monotonically increasing pattern of cumulative development factors (CDFs) to develop a new semi-parametric reserving model that does not require a density assumption. To allow the maximum utilization of available information\, we also propose an enhanced sampling approach that greatly increases the size of unbiased CDFs\, particularly in later development periods. Based on the enhanced samples\, a bootstrap technique is employed in the estimation of monotone splines\, from which incurred-but-not-reported (IBNR) reserves and prediction errors can be obtained. Associated technical features\, such as the consistency of estimator\, are discussed and demonstrated. Our simulation studies suggest that the new model improves the accuracy of IBNR reserving\, compared with a range of classic competing models. A real data analysis produces many consistent findings\, thus supporting the usefulness of the monotone spline model in actuarial and insurance practice.</span></p><p><b>Speaker Bio</b>:<i> </i><span><i>Yanlin Shi is a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Actuarial Studies and Business Analytics at the Macquarie University\, where he has been a faculty member since July 2017.

The method is robust\, trivial to implement and requires minimal assumptions. The idea is to take a weighted average of time series- and pooled forecasts/estimators\, with individual weights that are based on time series information. We show the forecast optimality of individual weights\, both in terms of minimax-regret and of mean squared forecast error. We then provide feasible weights that ensure good performance under weaker assumptions than those required by existing approaches. Unlike existing shrinkage methods\, our approach borrows the strength - but avoids the tyranny - of the majority\, by targeting individual (instead of group) accuracy and letting the data decide how much strength each individual should borrow. Unlike existing empirical Bayesian methods\, our frequentist approach requires no distributional assumptions\, and\, in fact\, it is particularly advantageous in the presence of features such as heavy tails that would make a fully nonparametric procedure problematic.</p><p>The working paper is available <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01596"><u>here</u></a>.<br></p><p><b>Speaker Bio</b>:<i> </i>Raffaella Giacomini is <span>a professor of Economics at University College London and </span><span>a senior economist and economic advisor at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.

Despite their widespread use in demography\, decomposition methods are less commonly used by actuaries. In this paper we develop a new approach for decomposing mortality improvement rate assumptions into the contribution of different causes of death. In particular\, we show how we can decompose a Generalized-Age-Period-Cohort (GAPC) mortality improvement rate model into the additive contribution of different causes of death. The methods introduced in this paper are useful for the communication of mortality improvement assumptions to users and decision makers and for shedding light into understanding the drivers of mortality change.  In addition\, the decomposition approach opens up new possibilities for deriving mortality projection using GAPC models. In particular\, the combination of this decomposition approach with forecast reconciliation methods has the potential to improve the accuracy of all-cause mortality projections. We illustrate the decomposition methods using U.S. mortality data by cause of death for the period 1959-2019.</span></p><p><b>Speaker Bio</b>:<i> </i><span><i>Andrés Villegas is a Senior Lecturer at the School of Risk and Actuarial Studies and an Associate Investigator at the ARC Centre of Excellence in Population Ageing Research (CEPAR) where he was previously a Research Fellow.

In this paper\, we propose a new class of time series models\, the functional quantile autoregression (FQAR) models\, in which the conditional distribution of the observation at the current time point is affected by its past distributional information\, and expressed as a functional of the past conditional quantile functions. The models can capture systematic influences of the past distributional information on the current conditional distribution\, and therefore constitute a significant extension of traditional time series models in which the effect of conditioning information is confined to only a few selected characteristics of the past distribution.</span></p>The FQAR models are similar to functional autoregression models. However\, different from conventional functional time series models which are based on functionally observed data\, the proposed model and method study functional dynamics in traditional time series data. In fact\, the FQAR models share some similar features to the GARCH model. However\, instead of only focusing on the dynamic relationship of the second moments (conditional variance)\, we look at the relationship between the current conditional distribution to the past conditional distribution in a functional autoregressive form. Stationary conditions of the model are provided. We propose a sieve estimator for the model. Under stationarity conditions\, the FQAR model converges and facilitates an estimation that does not depend on the initial quantile function. Identification is investigated. The asymptotic properties of the estimators are derived. A Monte Carlo experiment is conducted to investigate the finite sample performance of the proposed estimator and an empirical application to stock return time series highlights the proposed method.<br><p><b>Speaker Bio</b><span>:</span><i> </i><span>Chaohua Dong is a Professor at the School of Statistics and Mathematics\, Zhongnan University of Economics and Law.

SUMMARY:EBS Workshop Tontines in retirement decumulation : Professor An Chen
LOCATION:CL_16 Rainforest Walk\, Room S10\, Theatre (Bldg 25)\, Clayton Campus
DESCRIPTION:<br><i>** Prof An Chen is also giving a talk at our regular Friday seminar 2pm ***</i><br><i><br></i><br><i><br></i><br>Professor An Chen will give a workshop on Tontines in retirement decumulation.<br><p><b>The First Segment of the Presentation: </b>Tontine\,  which are retirement financial instruments designed to distribute longevity risk among a group of policyholders\, have recently gained significant attention from both researchers and industry professionals. These products offer cost advantages compared to traditional annuities but lack the stability of fixed payments for policyholders. In this initial part of the discussion\, I will introduce and evaluate various tontines and tontine-like products\, including tonuities\, antines\, and combinations of tontines with annuities.</p><p><b>The Second Segment of the Presentation:</b> In both normative and descriptive decision theory\, tontines and tontine-like retirement products have demonstrated their superiority over conventional annuity products. Typically\, this body of research assumes specific utility functions and compares optimal tontines to optimal annuities. In this section\, we will first explore an illustrative example where tontines outperform annuities due to subjective perceptions of mortality. Subsequently\, our focus will shift to practical implementations of annuities and tontines\, particularly constant annuities and natural tontines as outlined in Milevsky and Salisbury's work from 2015. By examining these products\, we will demonstrate that tontine benefits are preferred over annuity benefits across all utility preferences that maintain the monotonicity of consumption. The widespread theoretical support for tontines (or tontine-related products) in contrast to their limited adoption in practice presents an intriguing puzzle that we refer to as the "tontine puzzle."</p>

We show that the four risk constraints lead to the same optimal solution\, which differs from previous conclusions obtained from the corresponding concave optimization problem under a risk constraint. Compared with the benchmark (unconstrained) non-concave utility maximization problem\, all the four risk constraints effectively and equivalently reduce the set of zero terminal wealth\, but do not fully eliminate this set\, indicating success and failure of the respective financial regulations.</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><b>Speaker Bio</b>:<i> </i><span><i>An Chen is known for her work on life and pension insurance\, innovative retirement products\, and portfolio planning.

Since its introduction in 2019\, StoryWall has been integrated into more than 40 UNSW courses across multiple schools and faculties\, benefiting more than 12\,000 undergraduate and postgraduate students\, and has received overwhelmingly positive feedback from both students and academics. </p><br><p>The second innovation\, Sandbox\, pioneered by the UNSW Sandbox Program (unsw.to/sandbox)\, provides a platform that empowers tripartite collaboration among academics\, industry\, and students\, enabling them to co-develop solutions for contemporary business and societal challenges. Through transforming existing university courses into immersive 'Sandboxes'\, this innovation tackles the crucial issue of scalability in Work-Integrated Learning (WIL) by facilitating tripartite collaboration at scale. Through the innovative Sandbox framework\, the Program has transformed 25 undergraduate and postgraduate courses across multiple disciplines into real-world ‘Sandboxes’ for over 7\,800 students in less than 3 years. These students worked directly with academics in the UNSW Business School and over 160 industry practitioners to tackle more than 70 wicked problems\, generating impact across education\, research\, and social engagement. </p><br><p>This seminar will present the design principles\, implementation experiences\, and evaluation outcomes of these innovations\, providing opportunities for academics to discuss and explore new pedagogical strategies in fostering authentic\, engaging\, and industry-relevant learning experiences for students. </p><p><b>Speaker Bio</b>:<i> </i><span><i>Dr Kevin Liu is a UNSW Scientia Education Fellow and the Undergraduate Actuarial Program Director of the School of Risk and Actuarial Studies at the University of New South Wales.

With recent occurrences of extreme events\, it is important to understand their impact on binary outcomes such as employment status\, recession\, and country default. Our approach is based on Bayes' theorem and Pareto approximations at the tail\, allowing for a flexible relationship between covariates and outcomes. We further extend the discussion to static and dynamic panel data models accounting for individual-specific tail thickness. We establish consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed estimator. We evaluate its finite-sample properties in Monte Carlo simulations. In the empirical application\, we use a panel of small banks to study whether small banks become riskier when local housing prices experience a significant decline\, a channel crucial in the 2007-08 financial crisis.</p><p><b>Speaker Bio</b>:<i> </i><span>Laura Liu is Associate Professor at the Department of Economics\, </span>University of Pittsburgh<span>.

This paper focuses  on the Dutch disease and Balassa-Samuelson theory to analyze long-term macroeconomic trends and structural drivers in oil-exporting countries.  To this end\, we estimate a structural VAR model with common trends to extract low-frequency movements in oil production\, non-oil productivity\, and other macroeconomic variables\, including the real exchange rate. The model is estimated using Bayesian techniques and applied to Canada and Norway\, two resource rich economies. In alignment with theory\, results indicate that oil significantly influences non-oil productivity and the real exchange rate in both countries.

This paper employs a novel econometric micro approach to forecasting exchange rates based on a large panel of individual stock prices\, which is expected to contain valuable information about future exchange rates according to economic theory. Our results demonstrate that this novel micro forecasting method significantly enhances the accuracy of exchange rate forecasting when compared to macro-econometric models such as Random Walk\, AR and Factor family models. By employing machine learning algorithms\, we can effectively aggregate the information contained in individual stock prices\, which leads to more precise exchange rates forecasts.

To address this issue\, an active strand of research utilizes distributionally robust optimization\, which aims to make data-driven decisions by considering the worst-case scenario within an uncertainty ball believed to contain the true distribution.<br><br>Consider two agents (say\, a wholesaler and a retailer\, or a reinsurer and an insurer) who operate at different monopoly levels in the market. When evaluating the same risk position\, they are subject to different levels of uncertainty due to factors such as their different capacities for possessing or handling data. Consequently\, after agent 1 makes a distributionally robust decision regarding the risk position\, agent 2 needs to further robustify it due to its exposure to additional uncertainty.<br>    <br>We investigate this two-stage robustification problem. Uncertainty balls are constructed using well-known distances such as the $\\phi$ divergence and the Wasserstein metric. Our study highlights the divergence-based risk measure\, which is defined by taking the supremum of the expectation over an uncertainty ball described by the $\\phi$ divergence. A series of analytic results is derived\, most of which become completely explicit for the special case of linear portfolios.<br><br>This talk is based on a working paper in progress joint with Jose Blanchet (Stanford)\, Fabio Gómez (UNSW)\, and Spiridon Penev (UNSW).<br><br>Kind regards<br>Shanika\, Dan and Bonsoo

Fentanyl is smuggled from abroad\, with little evidence<br>on how this happens. We show that fentanyl smuggling occurs via legal trade flows\, with<br>a positive relationship between state-level imports and drug overdoses that accounts for<br>15\,000-20\,000 deaths per year.

For example\, they are more accurate than a Least Squares or Maximum Likelihood estimator for an ARIMA model when the time series has been generated by an ARIMA.<br><br>An immediate benefit of this result is that pre-trained models can be deployed in place of existing forecasting solutions based on known processes\, delivering accuracy gains at orders of magnitude faster compute time (even when run on CPU). More importantly\, the method can approximately solve forecasting problems that have remained open and puzzled the forecasting community for decades\, such as the notorious Optimal Forecast Model Selection/Combination\, or derivation of good estimators for time series with complex uncertainty structures (mixtures\, varying volatility\, extreme events) or with structural breaks. It turns out that these processes are difficult to solve analytically\, but trivial to simulate from.<br><br>These pre-trained models\, after being trained on several orders of magnitude more data than other time series foundation models\, achieve state-of-the-art in some of the main forecasting benchmark datasets already off-the-shelf\, and further benefit from fine-tuning. We will end with a discussion of interesting challenges that arise from training via simulations: what to do when we have 'infinite data'?<br><br>Kind regards<br>Shanika\, Dan and Bonsoo

A strong rationale\, a well-developed theoretical framework and\, as we show\, empirical support exist for multivariate time series with a singular spectral density. A singular spectral density is consistent with economic theory underlying\, for example\, DSGE models in which the number of variables is greater than the number of structural shocks. This assumption guarantees the existence of a finite order VAR representation but there does not exist a unique probability density function with respect to the Lebesgue measure. We therefore define a density on a compact submanifold with respect to the Hausdorff measure and\, in a Bayesian framework\, develop an HMC algorithm that jointly samples coefficients\, lag length\, and the number of shocks. We use the proposed framework to carry out structural analysis on the US macroeconomy with COVID shocks.<br><br>Kind regards<br>Shanika\, Dan and Bonsoo

Improving predictive accuracy is therefore extremely valuable. Data science researchers design algorithms\, models\, and approaches to improve prediction. Prediction is also improved with larger and richer data. Beyond improving algorithms and data\, platforms can stealthily achieve better prediction accuracy by pushing users’ behaviors towards their predicted values\, using behavior modification techniques\, thereby demonstrating more certain predictions. Such apparent ‘‘improved’’ prediction can result from employing reinforcement learning algorithms that combine prediction and behavior modification. This strategy is absent from the machine learning and statistics literature. Investigating its properties requires integrating causal with predictive notation. To this end\, we incorporate Pearl’s causal do(.) operator into the predictive vocabulary. We then decompose the expected prediction error given behavior modification and identify the components impacting predictive power. Our derivation elucidates implications of such behavior modification to data scientists\, platforms\, their customers\, and the humans whose behavior is manipulated. Behavior modification can make users’ behavior more predictable and even more homogeneous\; yet this apparent predictability might not generalize when business customers use predictions in practice. Outcomes pushed towards their predictions can be at odds with customers’ intentions\, and harmful to manipulated users.<br><br>Kind regards<br>Shanika\, Dan and Bonsoo

While the estimation of directional connectedness using forecast error variance decompositions is well-established\, our contribution lies in the development of hypothesis testing procedures that provide a statistical foundation to formally test the significance of these connectedness measures. To address the multiple testing issue\, we present detailed algorithms for both single-step and step-down p-value adjustments to effectively control the familywise error rate in finite samples. We also extend our methodology to include cluster-based analysis\, thereby broadening the applicability of our approach. Simulation results confirm that our procedures not only ensure the simultaneous finite-sample correctness of the set of inferences but also demonstrate good statistical power. Furthermore\, we illustrate our inference procedures through empirical applications that analyze return and volatility spillovers among global stock markets\, revealing new insights into financial market linkages.<br><br>Kind regards<br>Shanika\, Dan and Bonsoo

By contrast\, the local martingale theory suggests that bubbles are present when the price process is a strict local martingale in the risk-neutral measure (Q-bubbles). This paper unifies the discussion by showing that the two types of bubbles are distinct components of the asset risk premium. The empirical study on equities and ETFs highlights the role of Q-bubbles in asset pricing. The incremental information in Q-bubbles is useful for improving prediction of excess returns and constructing profitable market-timing trading strategies.</p><br>Kind regards<br>Dan\, Bonsoo and Ruben

Our proposed semi-parametric identification strategy uses weaker assumptions than those previously adopted in the literature and\, at the same time\, enjoys a new robustness property of reducing to classic nonparametric RD identification when the magnitude of extrapolation goes to zero. We applied our proposed method to extend the empirical analysis in Lindo et al. (2010} on college academic probation. Our method allows us to estimate the effect of academic probation for students not exactly at the probation GPA cutoff.<br><br>Kind regards<br>Dan\, Ben\, Michael and Klaus

These formulas establish mappings from copula parameters to rank correlation coeﬃcients\, potentially facilitating robust rank-based estimation of skew-elliptical copula models. Additionally\, we investigate and compare the impacts of asymmetry parameters on the properties of both rank correlations within these two classes of skew-elliptical models. Notably\, the introduction of asymmetry in normal location-scale mixture copulas restricts the attainable range of the rank correlations from [-1\,1] – as observed under elliptical symmetry – to a strict subset of [-1\,1]. In contrast\, the entire interval [-1\, 1] remains attainable for skew-normal scale mixture copulas.<br><br>Kind regards<br>Dan\, Ben\, Michael and Klaus

This technique combination enables handling high-dimensional data and reveals the relative importance of each individual forecast. First\, it is possible to enhance forecasting performance in certain practical instances by randomly selecting smaller subsets of individual forecasts and obtaining a new set of predictions based on a regression-based weighting scheme. The optimal value of selected individual forecasts is also empirically studied. Then\, a connection between RSM and SVD is proposed\, enabling the examination of each individual forecast’s contribution to the final prediction\, even when there is a large number of forecasts. This approach is model-agnostic (can be applied to any set of predictions) and facilitates understanding of how the aggregated prediction is obtained based on individual forecasts\, which is crucial for decision-makers.<br><br>Kind regards<br>Dan\, Ben\, Michael and Klaus</td></tr><tr><td><br><u></u><u></u><u></u><u></u><table><tbody><tr><td><h2><b>When</b></h2></td></tr></tbody></table>Thursday 17 Apr 2025 ⋅ 2pm – 3pm (Australian Eastern Time - Sydney)</td></tr></tbody></table>

Evaluation studies often focus on quantile treatment effects (QTE)\, which rely on the marginal distributions of potential treatment and control outcomes. Parameters that depend on the joint distribution of potential outcomes\, such as quantiles of the distribution of treatment effects (QDTE)\, receive less attention. We propose a strategy to identify these parameters. We leverage the property that\, under random assignment\, rank correlation coefficients between actual treatment and predicted control state outcomes are identical\, irrespective of whether predictions are based on treatment or control units. To identify QDTE\, we assume that all permutations of observation units satisfying this property are equally likely. Rearranging quantiles yields a generalized version of quantile treatment effects (GQTE). We employ a reweighting approach for identification under strong ignorability. We test the predictor strength and demonstrate that highly predictive covariates yield unbiased\, consistent\, and asymptotically normal estimators. Our analysis of Connecticut’s Jobs First program reveals initial income increases for a larger fraction of participants than previously recognized. Long-term gains were at least twice as large as those derived from conventional QTE and concentrated at the lower end of the distribution.</span><br><span><span><span><br>Kind regards<br>Dan\, Ben\, Michael and Klaus</span></span></span>

Thus we first introduce the concept of pseudo-true parameter value  for a test and investigate the pseduo-true value for the 2SLS-t test\, the Anderson-Rubin (AR) test\, the Lagrange Multiplier (LM)\, and the conditional likelihood ratio (CLR) test. We find that only the 2SLS-t test has a unique proper pseudo-true value that has an economic interpretation in a commonly considered scenario. We then focus attention on the 2SLS-t test pseudo-true value and design a group of tests that are robust to both weak IV and misspecification.<br><br>Kind regards<br>Dan\, Ben\, Michael and Klaus

However\, its reliance on the idealised assumption of perfect data exchangeability limits its effectiveness in the presence of real-world complications\, such as low-quality labels -- a widespread issue in modern large-scale data sets. We tackle this open problem by introducing an adaptive conformal inference method capable of efficiently handling deviations from exchangeability caused by random label noise\, leading to informative prediction sets with tight label-conditional and marginal coverage guarantees even in those challenging scenarios. This is obtained through a precise characterisation of the coverage inflation (or deflation) suffered by standard conformal inferences in the presence of label contamination\, which is then made actionable through a new calibration algorithm. Our solution can leverage different modelling assumptions about the contamination process\, while requiring no knowledge of the underlying data distribution or of the inner workings of the classification model. The empirical performance of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulations and real data.</p><p><br>Kind regards<br>Dan\, Ben\, Michael and Klaus</p>

Adding further frictions to the sequential auction model\, we find that job to job mobility is predominantly inefficient. That is moves are not purely in response to a financial surplus. Allowing for between job-to-job moves that should have occurred (higher surplus with an external firm) but did not\, and moves that did occur but should not have (lower surplus in destination firm)\, we estimate that the proportion of employees whose last state change is inefficient is about 35%. We also find that there is strong worker-firm sorting\, but this does not show up in wages. We investigate in detail the role of the dynamics of match-specific wage shocks and examine the decomposition of the variance of wages and of the match surplus. We find that the match output\, reflecting firm effects and worker-firm complementarities\, is small while the match-specific effect dominates.</p><p><br>Kind regards<br>Dan\, Ben\, Michael and Klaus</p></td></tr><tr><td><br><table><tbody><tr><td><h2><b>When</b></h2></td></tr></tbody></table>Friday 30 May 2025 ⋅ 2pm – 3pm (Australian Eastern Time - Sydney)</td></tr><tr><td><br><table><tbody><tr><td><h2><b>Location</b></h2></td></tr></tbody></table>CL_Chn-20.Menzies_S322 FF-Col (60)<br><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/search/CL_Chn-20.Menzies_S322+FF-Col+%2860%29?hl=en-GB" target="_blank"><b>View map</b></a></td></tr><tr><td><br><table><tbody><tr><td><h2><b>Organiser</b></h2></td></tr></tbody></table><br><a href="mailto:dan.zhu@monash.edu" target="_blank">Dan Zhu</a><br><a href="mailto:dan.zhu@monash.edu" target="_blank">dan.zhu@monash.edu</a></td></tr></tbody></table>

We seek to quantify the cost of latency\, which we define as the amount of information lost when a variable is latent instead of observed. We show that the cost of latency depends on the structure of the model\, specifically whether the latent variable affects the drift or the diffusion functions. To obtain these results\, we employ filtering techniques and develop a new theory of nonlinear continuous-time pseudo-filters based on stochastic partial differential equations. Monte Carlo evidence supports the theoretical findings.<br><br>Kind regards<br>Dan\, Ben\, Michael and Klaus

In reality\, predictive and causal relationships can appear\, disappear\, or reverse depending on contextual factors such as climate conditions or personality traits. Contextual machine learning has emerged in response\, providing a framework in which models adapt their structure and parameters to the context at hand. This talk explores recent advances\, including the contextual lasso\, which learns sparse models whose selected features and coefficients vary with context\, and contextual directed acyclic graphs\, which learn graphical structures whose topology evolves across contexts. These approaches employ model-generating neural networks that transform raw contextual information into context-conditioned parameters consistent with the intended model structure. The talk also covers new directions from an active collaboration in biostatistics.

We develop a novel approach to estimation based on full-information maximum likelihood that generalizes the insights from granular instrumental variables. We conclude that the supply responses of Saudi Arabia and adjustments of inventories have historically played a key role in stabilizingthe price of oil. We illustrate how our structural model can be used to analyze how individual producers and consumers would dynamically adapt to a geopolitical event such as a major disruption in the supply of oil from Russia.

This study estimates ECS as a common equilibrium parameter across energy balance models (EBMs). Fitting EBMs to simulated data from 31 climate models under a CO2 quadrupling experiment\, we introduce a Bayesian composite likelihood approach to simultaneously integrate and estimate all the constituent EBMs. Complementing methods of storylines and emergent constraints commonly employed by climate scientists\, our econometric alternative provides a data-driven ECS estimator. We find an ECS estimate of 3.65K\, characterized by a unimodal and right-skewed posterior distribution that facilitates uncertainty quantification. Our approach also yields a 95% credible interval of (2.5K\, 5K)\, which is narrower and closer to the upper bound of the IPCC’s “very likely” ECS range.

We study how landholders respond to such thresholds in Brazil’s Forest Code\, which conditions conservation requirements on property size. Using administrative microdata\, we document systematic manipulation of reported property sizes\, with a pronounced clustering just below the regulatory cutoff. These distortions are strongest in high-deforestation frontier regions and are amplified by land titling and regularization programs\, suggesting that overlapping institutions can reinforce rather than mitigate avoidance. We then show that\, despite widespread manipulation\, properties that remain above the threshold exhibit higher forest retention and lower conversion to pasture. Taken together\, the results highlight a central tradeoff of size-based rules: they generate strong incentives to circumvent regulation\, yet still deliver meaningful conservation where obligations bind. More broadly\, the findings illustrate how policy thresholds interact with weak property registries to shape both compliance and evasion.<br><p dir="ltr"><span>Bio: Kathryn Baragwanath is a Senior Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in the Department of Economics at the University of Melbourne.

SUMMARY:Workshop: High Dimensional Network Analysis and Programme Evaluation
LOCATION:Room H914\, Building H\, Caulfield Campus
DESCRIPTION:Dear all\, <br><br><a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/economics/people/yongcheol-shin/" target="_blank">Prof Yongcheol Shin</a> from University of York\, UK\, will be visiting EBS\, Monash and will deliver a one-day workshop on ‘High Dimensional Network Analysis and Programme Evaluation’ on 23 September\, 2025.<br><br>This one-day workshop will focus on recent theoretical and empirical developments in the panel data literature on cross-section dependence (CSD)\, spatial heterogeneity\, and programme evaluation in the presence of network interference. The aim of the workshop is to discuss the most updated panel data econometric techniques in the field and provide related empirical applications.<br><br> The details of the workshop are below and attached:<br><br> <b>Date and Time</b>: Tuesday\, <b>23 September</b> 2025 <b>[9:45 AM - 4:30 PM] <br></b><br> Venue: Room H914\, Building H\, Caulfield Campus <br><br><b>About the course leader:</b> <a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/economics/people/yongcheol-shin/" target="_blank">Prof Yongcheol Shin</a>’s primary research interests lie in developing econometric models that can provide coherent and robust descriptions of stylised features of the underlying data in Economics and Finance\, based on the belief that quantitative modelling could provide a useful tool for forecasting and policy analysis. <br><br>His current research encompasses several distinct areas of applied and theoretical econometrics. He has been actively developing multidimensional models to address various important issues\, including spatial dependence\, heterogeneity\, nonlinearity\, endogenous spatial weights matrices\, network analysis\, and counterfactual treatment effects\, among others. It is of interest to develop more challenging and realistic models by combining both spatial- and factor-based hierarchical elements within 3D or higher-dimensional models. Simultaneously\, he has been working on several empirical applications that incorporate novel and advanced methodologies\; the GVAR-GCM modelling for an investigation of international and systemic interlinkages and policy (contagion) transmissions\, asymmetric monetary policy reaction functions\, asymmetric information contents of arbitrage in futures markets\, the quantile VAR approach to model tail connectedness behaviour in the financial networks\, and so on.

If we just use the information in the marginals assuming independence we have a consistent by inefficient estimator (QMLE) and the question is how to achieve asymptotic efficiency without sacrificing robustness\, that is\, without losing consistency. A parametric way to do this is to assume a copula and conduct a full MLE (FMLE). Turns out that this will not improve efficiency if the copula family is such that the copula score function is a linear combination of the marginal score functions\, a very rare condition\, which also guarantees robustness. The trouble is that if this condition does not hold we generally lose robustness unless the copula is correctly specified. An alternative is to model the copula nonparametrically\, possibly with a sparsity penalty induced by some machine learning method. The result is a semiparametric sieve MLE (SMLE) that reaches the semiparametric bound\, if consistent. However\, machine learning of copulas generally results in model selection errors. This requires the construction of Neyman orthogonal projections of the marginal scores that are insensitive to mistakes in the copula. Turns out that these projections are easily obtained using moment and parameter redundancy results in the GMM framework. The talk is based on a few papers coauthored with subsets of the following coauthors: David Drukker\, Di Liu\, Ivan Medovikov\, Valentyn Panchenko and Peter Schmidt. <br><br>Bio: <br><span>Artem is a professor with the Discipline of Business Analytics of the University of Sydney Business School\, a research fellow at the </span><span><u><a href="https://url.au.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/3FiBCK1DvKTM88WvJfMf1u51zbl?domain=cireqmontreal.com/" target="_blank">Centre interuniversitaire de recherche en économie quantitative (CIREQ</a>) </u></span><span>in Montreal\, a co-founder of the</span><span><u><a href="https://url.au.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/migPCL7EwMfwNN9pviqh9uyp9lR?domain=ceba-lab.org/" target="_blank"> International Research Center for Econometrics and Business Analytics (CEBA)</a></u></span><span> in St. Petersburg and a founding member of the </span><span><u><a href="https://url.au.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/jaR0CMwGxOtkxx30lfJiku8tFK9?domain=iseapa.org/" target="_blank">International Society for Efficiency and Productivity Analysis (ISEAPA)</a> </u></span><span>in Houston.

We implement a randomized light-touch CDS intervention targeting either mothers or fathers\, combining traditional testing methods with a novel automated speech analysis technology to evaluate effects on child language development. The intervention provided information on CDS benefits and practical implementation strategies through a video and calendar\, and included a picture book to address families' limited access to children's books. Results show the intervention significantly improved child language development—equivalent to nearly a year of developmental progress—but only when targeting mothers\, not fathers. The primary mechanism appears to be behavioural change rather than belief updating among mothers.<br><br>Bio: Dr. Diana Contreras Suarez is a Senior Research Fellow at the Melbourne Institute for Applied Economics and Social Research at The University of Melbourne.

This paper examines how foreign economic and financial shocks transmit through trade to small open Asian economies. We estimate a global vector autoregressive (GVAR) model\, linking the US\, the Euro Area\, China\, and Japan (G4) to the NIE-4 (Hong Kong\, Singapore\, South Korea\, and Taiwan) and the ASEAN-4 (Malaysia\, Indonesia\, Thailand\, and the Philippines) over 1980Q1 to 2019Q4. Country specific blocks include domestic macro-financial variables and their foreign counterparts constructed with time-varying trade weights to capture evolving linkages. The framework traces business-cycle co-movements and quantifies spillovers from G4 shocks to Asia\, highlighting heterogeneity between the NIE-4 and ASEAN-4 and identifying how changing trade patterns alter exposure to external disturbances. Our findings emphasise that increased trade relations with China have intensified the impact of its economic shocks in the region. At the same time\, although the influence of the US has relatively diminished over the years\, it continues to<br>be a crucial driver of growth in Asian economies.

We propose a joint test of the necessary and sufficient conditions for ASD that fully incorporates boundary constraints often ignored in the existing literature. Our approach accommodates general sampling schemes\, including weakly dependent time series\, thereby extending the applicability of stochastic dominance tests to a wide range of empirical contexts. The proposed procedures are uniformly valid\, unlike conventional methods based on pointwise asymptotic approximations\, and we further provide inference for a measure of violation from ASD. We also extend our results to the estimation of the horizon index and to the concept of Almost Time Stochastic Dominance (ATSD)\, which integrates temporal and risk-based dominance. The ASD framework is practically motivated by the need for robust welfare and policy comparisons when exact dominance rarely holds in finite samples or in the presence of measurement noise. By quantifying and testing for economically negligible violations of dominance\, our methods offer a more realistic and informative tool for decision analysis under uncertainty.

We show that this interpretation is incomplete: the VVIX also embeds a long-run variance (LRV) component. To establish this result\, we first demonstrate that regressions of squared VVIX on VOV proxies gain substantial explanatory power once LRV measures are incorporated. We then develop a tractable theoretical framework linking VVIX to three risk drivers—the instantaneous variance\, LRV\, and VOV—and show that the VVIX loads on both VOV and LRV. Our empirical analysis reveals that VVIX dynamics are dominated by LRV in calm markets\, but by VOV during financial stress. We further show that these variance components explain option returns in distinct markets: S&amp\;P 500 index option straddles load on the instantaneous variance and LRV\, while VIX option straddles load on the VOV. Taken together\, our results redefine the role of the VVIX\, establishing it as a measure of both VOV and LRV uncertainty\, with important implications for how it should be read and used by finance practitioners.

Identifying the most effective policies (or a mix thereof) is crucial to inform policy-makers that are often constrained in their choice set. Traditional methods for policy evaluation rely on precise knowledge about the occurrence and timing of interventions. Structural break identification on the other hand has a long tradition in the field of econometrics. Recent approaches cast the search for such breaks in the form of indicator-saturated regressions\, identifying step-shifts in relevant time series\, but lack a proper framework of uncertainty quantification. We introduce a coherent probabilistic framework for the detection of structural breaks with unknown timing in panel data. The proposed Bayesian setup naturally incorporates the quantification of break uncertainty with little overhead. Simulation studies demonstrate that our approach is competitive to existing approaches in detecting true positives and drastically reduces false positives. We apply our method to replicate studies on the effectiveness of climate policies in the European transport sector and provide novel insights in the dynamics of deforestation in the tropics.

We design a formal test for deciding whether violations of this fundamental no-arbitrage condition that links equity and options markets exist empirically. The test is nonparametric and uses high-frequency return data of an asset and zero-date options written on it. It utilizes the fact that when equity and options markets are fully integrated\, suitable portfolios of zero-date options are the optimal forecasts of future short-term volatility due to small and frequent moves in asset prices. Empirically\, we find evidence for episodes of disagreement between equity and options markets about volatility.
