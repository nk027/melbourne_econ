DESCRIPTION:Title:  Double Instrumental Variable Estimation of Interaction 
 Models with Big Data\n\nAbstract: The static factor analysis of a (n\,m) ma
 trix of observations Y is usually based on the joint spectral decomposition
  of the matrix squares YY' and Y'Y. However\, for very large dimensions m a
 nd n\, this approach has a high level of numerical complexity. Indeed\, the
  number of required computations grows cubically w.r.t. the matrix dimensio
 ns\, that is\, faster than the number of observations. The big data dimensi
 ons can be used to propose new estimation methods with a reasonable numeric
 al complexity. The double instrumental variable (IV) approach uses row inst
 ruments and column instruments to estimate consistently the factors up to K
 ^2 parameters\, where K is the number of factors. Then\, the factor model c
 an be concentrated and the K^2 missing parameters estimated consistently by
  ordinary least squares. The double IV approach can be used for the analysi
 s of recommender systems and is a new collaborative filtering approach.

DESCRIPTION:Title:\nSome aspects of Machine Learning methods for time serie
 s forecasting\n\nAbstract:\nI'll present a study where we examined model es
 timation of regime switching models. Concretely\, we worked with the neuro-
 coefficient smooth transition autoregressive model (NCSTAR)\, and used a sp
 ecial type of genetic algorithm (memetic algorithm with local search chains
 \, MA-LS-Chains) for model estimation.\n\nWe then had a look into evaluatio
 n procedures for forecasting methods\, from a Computer Science perspective 
 where for classification and regression the standard procedure is k-fold cr
 oss-validation with quadratic error measures. Here\, I present a study on t
 he use of different cross-validation techniques for predictor evaluation\, 
 and a study where these ideas are extended to directional accuracy measures
 .\n\nDuring the work on the PhD thesis\, 3 packages for R were developed. A
  neural network package called RSNNS\, a package called Rmalschains which i
 mplements the MA-LS-Chains genetic algorithm and a package called tsExpKit 
 which is a toolkit/framework for time series experiments\, containing among
  other things implementations of the discussed evaluation procedures.

 sk)\, and investigate their effects on the optimal solution. Our main contr
 ibutions are in obtaining an analytical solution under each of the four ris
 k constraints\, in the form of the optimal terminal wealth. We show that th
 e four risk constraints lead to the same optimal solution\, which differs f
 rom previous conclusions obtained from the corresponding concave optimizati
 on problem under a risk constraint. Compared with the benchmark (unconstrai
 ned) non-concave utility maximization problem\, all the four risk constrain
 ts effectively and equivalently reduce the set of zero terminal wealth\, bu

DESCRIPTION:Title: Estimation of Treatment Effects under Endogenous Heteros
 kedasticity\n\nAbstract: This paper considers a treatment effects model in 
 which individual treatment effects\nmay be heterogeneous\, even among obser
 vationally identical individuals. Specifically\, extending\nthe classical i
 nstrumental-variables (IV) model with an endogenous binary treatment and a 
 binary\ninstrument\, we allow the heteroskedasticity of the error disturban
 ce to depend upon the treatment\nvariable so that treatment generates both 
 mean and variance effects on the outcome. We show that\nsuch an endogeneity
  of the heteroskedasticity can be detected from the residuals of the standa
 rd\nIV estimation. Moreover\, in this endogenous heteroskedasticity IV (EHI
 V) model\, the standard IV\nestimator can be inconsistent and lead to incor
 rect inference. After establishing nonparametric\nidentification\, we provi
 de closed-form estimators for the linear EHIV for the mean and variance\ntr
 eatment effects\, the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT)\, and t
 he individual treatment\neffects (ITE). Asymptotic properties of the estima
 tors are provided. A Monte Carlo simulation\ninvestigates the performance o
 f the proposed approach. An empirical application regarding\nthe effects of
  fertility on female labor supply is considered\, and the findings demonstr
 ate the\nimportance of accounting for endogenous heteroskedasticity.

DESCRIPTION:Title: The Large-Sample Distribution of the Sharpe Ratio\n\nAbs
 tract: Given a $d$--vector $\\mu$ of expected asset (excess) returns and an
  associated covariance matrix $\\Sigma$\, the value of a portfolio  specifi
 ed by $d$-vector $x$ is obtained as a linear combination of $\\mu$ with $x$
 \,  and the Sharpe ratio for the portfolio is $x^T\\mu/\\sqrt{x^T \\Sigma x
 }$. In the Markowitz paradigm\, the portfolio having maximum Sharpe ratio i
 s optimal.\n\nI will review results obtained over the last 10 years or so c
 oncerning the large sample distribution of a sample version of the maximum 
 Sharpe ratio\,  assuming sample returns and covariance matrix are asymptoti
 cally normally distributed\, and considering both situations\, when short s
 ales are allowed or not. Some notable differences occur between these cases
  and also according to whether the population mean return vector is 0 or no
 t. In general\, the estimated maximum Sharpe ratio is not asymptotically no
 rmally distributed though in many cases it is.\n\nThe results permit rigoro
 us comparisons between allocations with short sales allowed or not\, giving
  a means of quantifying how much may be lost in investment decisions by dis
 allowing short sales. The theory will be illustrated on some real and some 
 simulated data.

 nsionalSample Auto-covariance Matrices</p><p><br><b>Abstract:</b> </p><p>We
  study the asymptotic theory of factor models for high-dimensional time ser
 ies and provide the central limit theorem(CLT) for spiked eigenvalues of hi
 gh-dimensional sample auto-covariance matrices. Under a general high-dimens
 ional setting where both dimension p and sample size T go to infinity and p
 /T converges to c &gt\; 0\, we consider high-dimensional time series to fol
 low a factor model where both the temporal and cross-sectional dependence a
 re assumed to be captured by a number off actors. The limiting normal distr
 ibutions for spiked eigenvalues of high-dimensional sample auto-covariance 
 matrices are established for both cases with either fixed or diverging lags
  of auto-covariance. Additionally\, as a statistical application of the CLT
 \, a novel auto-covariance test is proposed based on the difference between
  spiked eigenvalues of sample auto-covariance matrices for two high-dimensi
 onal time series. This auto-covariance test provides statistical inferences
  for comparing the spectral properties of two high-dimensional time series 
 and facilitates further statistical applications such as clustering on mult
 iple population high-dimensional time series. Lastly\, empirical simulation
 s\, as well as analysis of worldwide mortality data\, are also provided.</p

DESCRIPTION:Title: Inference on structural breaks using information criteri
 a\n\nAbstract: This paper investates the usefulness of information criteria
  for inference on the number of structural breaks in a standard linear regr
 ession model. In particular\, we propose a modified penalty function for su
 ch criteria\, which implies each break is equivalent to estimation of three
  individual regression coefficients. A Monte Carlo analysis compares inform
 ation criteria to sequential testing\, with the modified BIC and HQIC crite
 ria performing well overall\, for DGPs both without and with breaks. The me
 thods are also used to examine changes in Euro area monetary policy between
  1971 and 2007.\n\nProfessor Osborn is Robert Ottley Professor of Econometr
 ics at the University of Manchester. For more information\, please refer to

DESCRIPTION:Title: Taxpayer responsiveness to marginal tax rates: Bunching 
 was evidence from the Australian personal income tax system\nAbstract: Util
 izing the universe of taxpayer records from 2000 to 2014\, we examine taxpa
 yers’ responsiveness to marginal tax rates in Australia. Unlike studies fro
 m other countries\, we find sharp bunching at all kink points in the Austra
 lian tax system. Elasticities of tax- able income range from effectively ze
 ro for wage earners to around 0.26 for self-employed tax-filers. We find su
 bstantial heterogeneity in responses to changes in marginal tax rates acros
 s a range of sub-groups\, with higher elasticities for married females\, fe
 males with children and younger tax-filers. Elasticities appear to be decre
 asing over time.

DESCRIPTION:Title: From Strength to Strength: Extensions of the Elo Rating 
 System for Margin of Victory\n\nThe Elo rating system is one of the most po
 pular methods for estimating competitor ability over time in sport. The sta
 ndard Elo system focuses on expectations about wins and losses but there is
  often interest in the margin of victory (MOV) as it reflects the strength 
 of a performance. Theory for and comparisons of these types of models are l
 imited. In this talk\, I will present four model options for an MOV Elo sys
 tem: linear\, joint additive\, multiplicative\, and logistic. The talk will
  include a presentation of notation for each model\, guidance on model tuni
 ng\, and implementation examples in R. I will also provide real-world appli
 cations to professional tennis and discuss how MOV Elo models can have an i
 mpact at tennis events like the Australian Open. This general framework for
  MOV Elo ratings gives sports modellers a new set of tools when building sy
 stems to rate competitors and forecast outcomes in sport.

DESCRIPTION:Title: The Effect of Minimum Wage Increases on Wages\, Hours Wo
 rked and Job Loss\n\n \nAbstract: Australia has a detailed system of ‘award
 s’ that specify different minimum wages depending on the industry\, locatio
 n and skill of an employee. Using job-level data from a survey of firms\, t
 his paper examines the effect of award wage changes on wages\, hours worked
  and the job destruction rate. I exploit the fact that between 1998 and 200
 8\, award wages were increased by a flat dollar amount each year (say\, 50 
 cents per hour)\, irrespective of existing award wage levels. This led to l
 arger award wage rises in percentage terms for jobs whose award wages were 
 relatively low\, compared to those on higher award wages. I find that adjus
 tments to awards are almost fully passed on to wages in award-reliant jobs.
  I find no evidence that these small\, incremental increases in award wages
  have an adverse effect on hours worked or the job destruction rate.

DESCRIPTION:Abstract: The partitioning of political jurisdictions is becomi
 ng an increasingly common component of agreements to end ethnic conflict. W
 hile partitions have proved to be effective in achieving immediate peace\, 
 their effect on post-conflict recovery remains unclear. This paper studies 
 the effects of the partition which ended the 1992-1995 Bosnian War on the p
 ost-war provision of public goods at the municipality-level. Comparing tren
 ds in the provision of public schooling across partitioned and unpartitione
 d municipalities during the 1986-2006 period\, I find that partitioned muni
 cipalities provide 58 percent more primary schools and 37 percent more teac
 hers (per capita). I also find evidence which suggests that convergent pref
 erences – operating via ethnic politics – for ethnically oriented schools m
 ay be an important driver of the results\, although I cannot rule out the p
 ossibility of mechanical explanations. In addition\, as the increase in pub
 lic goods provision may be ethnically oriented\, only the ethnic majority p
 rofits from this arrangement. These findings imply that partitions generate
  ethnic inequality that may undermine the sustainability of peace in the lo
 ng run.<br>\n<a href="http://www.economics.unimelb.edu.au/who/profile.cfm?s

 Refined Assortment Optimization</span></p><p><span>(Joint work with Alvaro 
 Flores and Guillermo Gallego)</span><br></p><p><b>Abstract</b>: <span>In tr
 aditional assortment optimization\, profits may be improved by making some 
 products unavailable as part of the lost demand flows to higher margin prod
 ucts. The refined version of assortment optimization takes a more subtle ap
 proach to improve profits. This is done by selectively making some products
  less appealing\, thereby steering demand to more profitable products. Exam
 ples include but are not limited to offering longer delivery times\, insist
 ing on advanced purchases\, imposing waiting lists\, and lowering product t
 ransparency. Refined assortment optimization can significantly improve expe
 cted profits relative to traditional assortment optimization. For the laten
 t-class MNL\, the ratio can be as high as the number of products or the num
 ber of market segments\, whichever is smaller. As the refined assortment op
 timization is intractable\, we focus on the development of heuristics. We s
 how the revenue-ordered heuristic has the same performance guarantee relati

 refined assortment optimization problem as it does relative to the traditio
 nal</span><span> </span><span>non- personalized</span><span> </span><span>a
 ssortment optimization problem. Based on this finding\, we construct revenu
 e-ordered based heuristics for the refined assortment problem. In our exper
 iments for the latent-class MNL our heuristics yield expected revenues that
  are often higher than the optimal expected revenues for the traditional as
 sortment optimization problem. In extensive numerical studies our heuristic
 s outperform the ADXOPT algorithm adapted to refined assortments\, and a ge

DESCRIPTION:<b>Title:</b> Structural varying-coefficient regression to iden
 tify brain regions affecting motor impairment in Huntington disease<br><b><
 br>Abstract:</b> Structural varying-coefficient regression models are impor
 tant in many fields\, from finance and economics to biology and medicine. I
 n clinical studies\, prediction models are often essential for forecasting 
 and monitoring the progression of a disease. Developing prediction models i
 s a challenge when dealing with high-dimensional data since we do not know 
 which variables are related to the response variable of interest and this r
 elationship may depend on other continuous or categorical modifying variabl
 es as well. We formalize this problem as the varying-coefficient model sele
 ction and propose a novel variable selection method\, svReg\, that accounts
  for both continuous and categorical modifying variables. <br><br>Our contr
 ibutions are three-fold:<br>1. The svReg method is shown to better screen i
 rrelevant variables over the existing method that ignores the group structu
 re of categorical modifying variables and to lead to a prediction model wit
 h higher accuracy and easier interpretation. <br>2. Our method adequately c
 onsiders the pre-specified group structure among modifying variables in add
 ition to unstructured modifying variables. <br>3. The svReg approach is emp
 irically shown to perform better than existing methods such as the Lasso an
 d pLasso even when there is no categorical modifying variable or any pre-sp
 ecified group structure among modifying variables. <br><br>Using simulation
  studies\, we show our method selects less irrelevant variables compared to
  existing methods while choosing relevant variables correctly. This provide
 s us with a prediction model with higher specificity\, lower false discover
 y rate and lower mean squared error. <br><br>The proposed methodology is mo
 tivated by and illustrated using data from a Huntington disease study\; the
  result identifies brain regions associated with motor impairment accountin
 g for differentiated relationship by disease severity. To the best of our k
 nowledge\, our study is the first to identify the interaction effect betwee
 n disease severity and the volume of brain regions in a varying-coefficient
  model framework.<br><br>This is joint work with Rakheon Kim and Tanya Garc
 ia\, both at Texas A&amp\;M\, Department of Statistics.&nbsp\;&nbsp\;

DESCRIPTION:Title: Modeling Vast Panels of Volatilities with Long-Memory Dy
 namic Factor Models (joint with Matteo Luciani)<br>\n\nAbstract<br>\nModeli
 ng vast panels of volatilities has always been an issue of paramount import
 ance\, yet elusive. These volatilities\, when observed through time\, share
  certain stylized facts:\nco-movement\, clustering and long-memory. Based o
 n Dynamic Factor Models\, we propose a methodology that i) disentangles bet
 ween commonness and idiosyncrasies\, ii) is suitable for large dimensions\,
  and iii) explains the above-mentioned stylized facts. A throughout Monte C
 arlo study shows the usefulness of the approach both in terms of factor ide
 ntification and parameter estimation. An application to 90 daily realized v
 olatilities\, pertaining to S&P100\, from January 2001 to December 2008\, e
 vinces five findings. i) All the volatilities have long memory\, more than 
 half of them in the nonstationary range\, which increases during financial 
 turmoil. ii) Tests and criteria point towards one dynamic common factor dri
 ving the co-movements\, which naturally qualifies as the unobservable marke
 t volatility. iii) This factor has larger long memory that the assets volat
 ilities\, suggesting that\nlong-memory is a market characteristic. Indeed\,
  the idiosyncratic components show a much smaller deal of fractional integr
 ation. iv) The time-varying long-memory is mainly due to the common factor\
 , while the degree of long-memory in the idiosyncrasies is relatively stabl
 e. v) a forecasting horse race with univariate models shows the factor mode
 ls overwhelming win for short-\, medium- and long-run predictions.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Bayesian Inference for Regression Copulas\n\n\nAbstract:
  We propose a new semiparametric distributional regression smoother that is
  based on a copula decomposition of the joint distribution of the vector of
  response values. The copula is high-dimensional and constructed by inversi
 on of a pseudo regression\, where the conditional mean and variance are sem
 iparametric functions of covariates modeled using regularized basis functio
 ns. By integrating out the basis coefficients\, an implicit copula process 
 on the covariate space is obtained\, which we call a “regression copula.” W
 e combine this with a nonparametric margin to define a copula model\, where
  the entire distribution— including the mean and variance—of the response i
 s a smooth semiparametric function of the covariates. The copula is estimat
 ed using both Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and variational Bayes\; the latter of
  which is scalable to high dimensions. Using real data examples and a simul
 ation study\, we illustrate the efficacy of these estimators and the copula
  model. In a substantive example\, we estimate the distribution of half-hou
 rly electricity spot prices as a function of demand and two time covariates
  using radial bases and horseshoe regularization. The copula model produces
  distributional estimates that are locally adaptive with respect to the cov
 ariates\, and predictions that are more accurate than those from benchmark 
 models.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Testing hypotheses as a mixture estimation problem\n\nAb
 stract: We consider a novel paradigm for Bayesian testing of hypotheses and
  Bayesian model comparison. Our alternative to the traditional construction
  of posterior probabilities that a given hypothesis is true or that the dat
 a originates from a specific model is to consider the models under comparis
 on as components of a mixture model. We therefore replace the original test
 ing problem with an estimation one that focus on the probability weight of 
 a given model within a mixture model. We analyse the sensitivity on the res
 ulting posterior distribution on the weights of various prior modelling on 
 the weights. We stress that a major appeal in using this novel perspective 
 is that generic improper priors are acceptable\, while not putting converge
 nce in jeopardy. Among other features\, this allows for a resolution of the
  Lindley-Jeffreys paradox. When using a reference Beta B(a\,a) prior on the
  mixture weights\, we note that the sensitivity of the posterior estimation
 s of the weights to the choice of a vanishes with the sample size increasin
 g and advocate the default choice a=0.5\, derived from Rousseau and Mengers
 en (2011). Another feature of this easily implemented alternative to the cl
 assical Bayesian solution is that the speeds of convergence of the posterio
 r mean of the weight and of the corresponding posterior probability are qui
 te similar.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Spot the volatilty: the break preserving local linear es
 timator\n\nAbstract:\nThe objective of this paper is to introduce the break
  preserving local linear (BPLL) estimator for the estimation of unstable vo
 latility functions for independent and asymptotically independent processes
 . Breaks in the structure of the conditional mean and/or the volatility fun
 ctions are common in Finance. Nonparametric estimators are well suited thes
 e events due to the flexibility of their functional form and their good asy
 mptotic properties. However\, the local polynomial kernel estimators are no
 t consistent at points where the volatility function has a break. The estim
 ator presented in this paper generalises the classical local linear (LL). T
 he BPLL maintains the desirable properties of the LL with regard to the bia
 s and the boundary estimation while it estimates the breaks consistently. A
 n extensive Monte Carlo study is shown as well as detailed proofs of the es
 timator asymptotic behaviour.\n\n<a href="http://ideas.repec.org/f/pca472.h

 linear dynamic panel data models\n\nAbstract: Neither the Dif(ference) mome
 nt conditions\, see Arellano and Bond (1991)\, nor the Lev(el) moment condi
 tions\, see Arellano and Bover (1995) and Blundell and Bond (1998)\, identi
 fy the parameters of linear dynamic panel data models for all data generati
 ng processes for the initial observations that accord with them when the da
 ta is persistent. The combined Dif-Lev (Sys) moment conditions do not alway
 s identify the parameters either when there are three time series observati
 ons but do so for larger numbers of time series observations. Thus the Sys 
 moment conditions always identify the parameters when there are more than t
 hree time series observations. To determine the optimal GMM procedure for a
 nalyzing the parameters in linear dynamic panel data models\, we construct 
 the power envelope and find that the KLM statistic from Kleibergen (2005) m
 aximizes the rejection frequency under the worst case alternative hypothesi
 s whilst always being size correct under the null hypothesis.\n\nFor a copy

DESCRIPTION:Title: Mistargeting of Cash Transfers\, Social Capital Destruct
 ion and Crime in Indonesia\n\nAbstract: Cash transfer programs can be a use
 ful tool for providing support for poor households in developing countries.
  The potential for substantial mistargeting is however high. This paper foc
 uses on the potential social consequences arising from misallocation of res
 ources in close knit communities. We find that the mistargeting of a cash t
 ransfer program in Indonesia is significantly associated with increases in 
 crime and declines in social capital within communities. Hence there exists
  a potentially large negative downside associated with poor targeting perfo
 rmance that extends beyond the pure financial costs that have been the focu
 s of the literature to date.

 : Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) has become an increasingly popular
  techniqe for the fitting of complex Bayesian models when the likelihood fu
 nction is unavailable or computationally intractable. In the past 10 years 
 it has received widespread application across many different scientific dis
 ciplines. ABC methods are simple to use (they were invented by Biologists)\
 , and have gradually increased in efficiency and sophistication as research
 ers have begun to understand their properties.\n\nHowever ABC methods suffe
 r greatly from the curse of dimensionality -- as the number model parameter
 s grows\, their performance can deteriorate rapidly. This is problematic as
  the popularity of ABC means that it is being applied to ever more complex 
 (and higher dimensional) problems. In this presentation\, I will introduce 
 ABC methods and illustrate both their practical utility and their poor perf
 ormance in high dimensions. I will then discuss some useful ways in which s
 tandard ABC techniques may be extended in moderate and higher dimensions\, 
 demonstrating that there is a strong future for ABC methods in applied rese
 arch.

 yet children in low-resource settings receive substantially less CDS than t
 heir peers in higher-resource contexts. We implement a randomized light-tou
 ch CDS intervention targeting either mothers or fathers\, combining traditi
 onal testing methods with a novel automated speech analysis technology to e
 valuate effects on child language development. The intervention provided in
 formation on CDS benefits and practical implementation strategies through a
  video and calendar\, and included a picture book to address families' limi
 ted access to children's books. Results show the intervention significantly
  improved child language development—equivalent to nearly a year of develop
 mental progress—but only when targeting mothers\, not fathers. The primary 
 mechanism appears to be behavioural change rather than belief updating amon
 g mothers.<br><br>Bio: Dr. Diana Contreras Suarez is a Senior Research Fell

 nURL (with link to CV): http://home.uchicago.edu/~dkozbur/\n\nTitle: 'Infer
 ence in Additively Seperable Models with a High Dimensional Component''\n\n
 Abstract: This paper provides inference results for series estimators with 
 a high\ndimensional component. This allows\, for example\, estimation of a 
 nonlinear response\nof an outcome variable given a treatment variable of in
 terest while accounting for\npotentially very many confounders. This paper 
 considers a variable selection procedure\nfor choosing confounding terms th
 at generalizes the post-double selection procedure\ngiven in Belloni\, Cher
 nozhukov\, Hansen (2013) to the nonparametric setting. In one\nstage\, vari
 ables are selected if they are relevant for predicting the treatment. In a\
 nsecond stage\, variables are selected if they are relevant in predicting t
 he treatment\nregressor of interest. The proposed method therefore formaliz
 es considerations for\ntrading o estimation precision with omitted variable
 s bias for the impact of a variable\nof interest on an outcome. At the same
  time\, the results explicitly account for added flexibility in allowing an
  unknown functional form for the response of the outcome\nto regressor of i
 nterest given confounders. A key condition which makes inference in\nthis s
 etting possible is sparsity\; there is a small (unknown) subset of terms wh
 ich can\nreplace the entire series without inducing significant bias. Rates
  of convergence and\nasymptotic normality are derived for series estimators
  of a component of a conditional\nexpectation in high dimensional models un
 der sparsity conditions. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that the proposed 
 estimator performs favorably in terms of size of tests\nand risk properties
  relative to other estimation strategies.

 e: Focused Information Criterion and Model Averaging for Large Panels with 
 a Multifactor Error Structure\n\nAbstract: This paper considers model selec
 tion and model averaging in panel data models with a multifactor error stru
 cture. We investigate the limiting distribution of the common correlated ef
 fects estimator (Pesaran\, 2006) in a local asymptotic framework and show t
 hat the trade-off between bias and variance remains in the asymptotic theor
 y. We then propose a focused information criterion and a plug-in averaging 
 estimator for large heterogeneous panels and examine their theoretical prop
 erties. The novel feature of the proposed method is that it aims to minimiz
 e the sample analog of the asymptotic mean squared error and can be applied
  to cases irrespective of whether the rank condition holds or not. Monte Ca
 rlo simulations show that both proposed selection and averaging methods gen
 erally achieve lower expected squared error than other methods. The propose
 d methods are applied to analyze the consumer response to gasoline taxes.\n

DESCRIPTION:Title: Decriminalization and Initiation into Cannabis Use\n\nAb
 stract: This study exploits variation in the timing of cannabis policy refo
 rms across Australia to determine the impact of decriminalization on initia
 tion into cannabis use. To do so\, we use a unique data set that merges ind
 ividual level information on drug use with detailed information on cannabis
  policies from  all Australian jurisdictions. Using a discrete-time hazard 
 approach\, we find that decriminalizing cannabis shifts the age distributio
 n of uptake towards younger ages. In addition\, we provide evidence that th
 e increase in uptake at younger ages is greater the longer the policy of de
 criminalization has been in place.\n\nProfessor Jenny Williams is a Profess

 in parallel trends being violated with D even when they hold with the true

DESCRIPTION:Title: \nComputing highly accurate frequentist confidence limit
 s from discrete data\n\nAbstract: \nFor discrete data\, frequentist confide
 nce limits based on a normal approximation to standard likelihood based piv
 otal quantities can perform poorly even for quite large sample sizes. To co
 nstruct exact limits requires the probability of a suitable tail set as a f
 unction of the unknown parameters. In this paper\, importance sampling (als
 o known as the scoring method) is used to estimate this surface and hence t
 he confidence limits. The technology is simple and straightforward to imple
 ment. Unlike the recent methodology of Garthwaite and Jones (2009)\, the ne
 w method allows for nuisance parameters\; is an order of magnitude more eff
 icient than the Robbins-Monro bound\; does not require any simulation phase
 s or tuning constants\; gives a straightforward simulation standard error f
 or the target limit\; includes a simple diagnostic for simulation breakdown
 . Future research will investigate other applications of the scoring method
  to statistical problems.

DESCRIPTION:Monte Carlo simulation for econometricians: methods\, accuracy\
 , methodology\n\nMany studies in econometric theory are supplemented by Mon
 te Carlo simulation investigations. These illustrate the properties of alte
 rnative inference techniques when applied to samples drawn from mostly enti
 rely synthetic data generating processes. They should provide information o
 n how techniques\, which may be sound asymptotically\, perform in finite sa
 mples. Ideally they unveil how the major properties of inference procedures
  depend on characteristics of the modelled data generating process and the 
 magnitude of nuisance parameters\, especially when these dependencies are t
 oo complex to derive analytically.\nThis short course addresses the fundame
 ntals of conceiving and executing such simulation studies and focuses with 
 hands-on EViews and Matlab illustrations on:\n1. Assessment by simulation o
 f the major characteristics of estimators and test statistics such as first
  and second moments\, cumulative distribution functions\, tail probabilitie
 s and quantiles.\n2. Analysis of the determining factors of the accuracy of
  simulation assessments of the bias and root mean squared errors of estimat
 ors and the rejection probabilities of test statistics. This leads to rules
  of thumb regarding the required number of simulation replications.\n3. Des
 igning effective and efficient simulation studies\, with special attention 
 to: organizing fair tournaments between competing techniques\, transforming
  the parameter space of a synthetic data generating process into a simulati
 on design parameter space with useful orthogonality properties and reduced 
 dimensionality.\n4. Discussion of options for dedicated simulation studies 
 based on actual empirical data and a postulated actual data generation proc
 ess\, and of the differences in purpose and achievements of Monte Carlo sim
 ulation with related techniques such as Monte Carlo testing and bootstrappi
 ng.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Regime-Switching Heston's Stochastic Volatility Model an
 d Option Price\n \nAbstract:\n \nIn this article we suggest and estimate re
 gime-switching Heston's stochastic volatility model by maximum likelihood e
 stimation method. Because the likelihood function for the Heston (1993) mod
 el is not known\, we construct an approximate log-likelihood function by us
 ing the irreducible method suggested by Aït-Sahalia (2008). In our model\, 
 the parameters are allowed to change to incorporate the possible regime shi
 fts in the underlying data generating process of the data. We use the S&P 5
 00 index for the stock price and the VIX data to compute proxy for the vola
 tility state variable. The unobservable regime state variable follows a con
 tinuous time first order Markov chain and the transition probabilities depe
 nd on the state variable. The recursive algorithm developed by Hamilton (19
 89) is applied to compute likelihood in order to conduct MLE. We found a st
 rong evidence for regime shifts in the data. And then we use the resulting 
 estimates to compute option prices to investigate implication of our model 
 in terms of option pricing.

 >Contextual Machine Learning: Models as Functions of Context<br><span><span
 ><span><span> <br>Abstract: </span></span></span></span>Traditional machine
  learning starts from the premise that a single fixed model can faithfully 
 represent an entire population. In reality\, predictive and causal relation
 ships can appear\, disappear\, or reverse depending on contextual factors s
 uch as climate conditions or personality traits. Contextual machine learnin
 g has emerged in response\, providing a framework in which models adapt the
 ir structure and parameters to the context at hand. This talk explores rece
 nt advances\, including the contextual lasso\, which learns sparse models w
 hose selected features and coefficients vary with context\, and contextual 
 directed acyclic graphs\, which learn graphical structures whose topology e
 volves across contexts. These approaches employ model-generating neural net
 works that transform raw contextual information into context-conditioned pa
 rameters consistent with the intended model structure. The talk also covers
  new directions from an active collaboration in biostatistics.

 ><b>Title:&nbsp\;</b>Subspace Shrinkage in Conjugate Bayesian Vector Autore
 gressions</p><p><br><br><b>Abstract:&nbsp\;</b>Macroeconomists using large 
 datasets often face the choice of working with either a large Vector Autore
 gression (VAR) or a factor model. In this paper\, we develop methods for co
 mbining the two using a subspace shrinkage prior. Subspace priors shrink to
 wards a class of functions rather than directly forcing the parameters of a
  model towards some pre-specified location. We develop a conjugate VAR prio
 r which shrinks towards the subspace which is defined by a factor model. Ou
 r approach allows for estimating the strength of the shrinkage as well as t
 he number of factors. After establishing the theoretical properties of our 
 proposed prior\, we carry out simulations and apply it to US macroeconomic 
 data. Using simulations we show that our framework successfully detects the
  number of factors. In a forecasting exercise involving a large macroeconom
 ic data set we find that combining VARs with factor models using our prior 
 can lead to forecast improvements.</p><p><b>arxiv link:&nbsp\;</b><a href="

 st Optimization<br><br><b>Abstract</b>:<br><br>Decision-making based on emp
 irical distributions suffers from the notorious issue of model uncertainty.
  To address this issue\, an active strand of research utilizes distribution
 ally robust optimization\, which aims to make data-driven decisions by cons
 idering the worst-case scenario within an uncertainty ball believed to cont
 ain the true distribution.<br><br>Consider two agents (say\, a wholesaler a
 nd a retailer\, or a reinsurer and an insurer) who operate at different mon
 opoly levels in the market. When evaluating the same risk position\, they a
 re subject to different levels of uncertainty due to factors such as their 
 different capacities for possessing or handling data. Consequently\, after 
 agent 1 makes a distributionally robust decision regarding the risk positio
 n\, agent 2 needs to further robustify it due to its exposure to additional
  uncertainty.<br>    <br>We investigate this two-stage robustification prob
 lem. Uncertainty balls are constructed using well-known distances such as t
 he $\\phi$ divergence and the Wasserstein metric. Our study highlights the 
 divergence-based risk measure\, which is defined by taking the supremum of 
 the expectation over an uncertainty ball described by the $\\phi$ divergenc
 e. A series of analytic results is derived\, most of which become completel
 y explicit for the special case of linear portfolios.<br><br>This talk is b

DESCRIPTION:Title: Financial Bubble Implosion\n\nAbstract: Expansion and co
 llapse are two key features of a financial asset bubble. Bubble expansion m
 ay be modeled using a mildly explosive process. Bubble implosion may take s
 everal different forms depending on the nature of the collapse and therefor
 e requires some flexibility in modeling. This paper develops analytics and 
 studies the performance characteristics of the real time bubble monitoring 
 strategy proposed in Phillips\, Shi and Yu (2014b\,c\, PSY) under alternati
 ve forms of bubble implosion that can be represented in terms of mildly int
 egrated processes which capture various return paths to market normalcy. We
  propose a new reverse sample use of the PSY procedure for detecting crises
  and estimating the date of market recovery. Consistency of the dating esti
 mators is established and the limit theory addresses new complications aris
 ing from the alternative forms of bubble implosion and the endogeneity effe
 cts present in the reverse regression. Simulations explore the finite sampl
 e performance of the strategy for dating maket recovery and an illustration
  to the Nasdaq stock market is provided. A real-time version of the strateg
 y is provided that is suited for practical implementation.

DESCRIPTION:Welfare Dependence and Self-Control: An Empirical Analysis\n\nA
 BSTRACT\n\nThis paper investigates the behavioral and policy mechanisms tha
 t generate dependence on welfare programs. A dynamic model with labor suppl
 y disincentives and state dependence in preferences is expanded to incorpor
 ate time-inconsistency\, which induces addictive behavior due to problems o
 f self-commitment. Estimation is based on data from a welfare reform experi
 ment\, which contains a unique policy feature that helps identify the time 
 preference parameters. Various results indicate that the commitment problem
  is an important consideration in the design of policy. Around one-fourth o
 f the individuals are time-inconsistent\, and neglecting time-inconsistency
  will cause state dependence in preferences to be overestimated. These indi
 viduals are more responsive to policy changes due to the presence of commit
 ment-related incentives. Time-inconsistency reduces income and net tax cont
 ribution by at least 15 and 50 percent\, respectively. An increase in welfa
 re benefits aggravates the commitment problem\, and reduces utility from a 
 time-consistent perspective. Certain dynamic policy interventions are more 
 effective than static interventions in alleviating the commitment problem. 
 For instance\, a dynamic nonwork tax generates strong commitment-related wo
 rk incentives\, and over half of time-inconsistent individuals will volunta
 rily adopt it as a commitment device. The implications of time-inconsistenc
 y for other policy interventions\, such as Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) 
 and a prowork time limit\, are examined.\n\nhttp://www.finance.uts.edu.au/s

 >Abstract</b>:  We use French matched employer-employee data to estimate a 
 structural model of wage dynamics. Adding further frictions to the sequenti
 al auction model\, we find that job to job mobility is predominantly ineffi
 cient. That is moves are not purely in response to a financial surplus. All
 owing for between job-to-job moves that should have occurred (higher surplu
 s with an external firm) but did not\, and moves that did occur but should 
 not have (lower surplus in destination firm)\, we estimate that the proport
 ion of employees whose last state change is inefficient is about 35%. We al
 so find that there is strong worker-firm sorting\, but this does not show u
 p in wages. We investigate in detail the role of the dynamics of match-spec
 ific wage shocks and examine the decomposition of the variance of wages and
  of the match surplus. We find that the match output\, reflecting firm effe
 cts and worker-firm complementarities\, is small while the match-specific e
 ffect dominates.</p><p><br>Kind regards<br>Dan\, Ben\, Michael and Klaus</p

 /u></p><p><b>Abstract</b>: The context of the talk is forecast error. This 
 is generally regarded as consisting of three components. The names assigned
  to these vary from one discipline to another\, but in actuarial science\, 
 they are known as parameter\, process and model errors. The first two of th
 ese components\, and their estimation\, are well understood but less so mod
 el error.</p><p>Model error itself is considered in two parts: one part tha
 t is capable of estimation from past data (internal model error (“IME”))\, 
 and another part that is not (external model error). Attention is focused h
 ere on IME. Estimation of IME is approached by means of Bayesian model aver
 aging (“BMA”)\, where the</p><p>population of models to be averaged\, and t
 heir prior probabilities\, are obtained from a LASSO model. The population 
 of models entering into the BMA may turn out to be “thinner” than desired\,
  and bootstrapping of the LASSO is used to gain bulk. A few intensely pract
 ical issues arise in this process\,</p><p>and they are discussed. The major
 ity of the discussion applies to forecasting generally\, but numerical illu
 stration of the concepts is given in relation to insurance data and the pro
 blem of insurance loss reserving.</p>This is a one-hour seminar\, with 50 m
 inutes for the presentation and 10 minutes at the end for questions.<br><br

DESCRIPTION:In this paper we aim to contribute to the literature on econome
 tric methods for large datasets. We introduce a Bayesian procedure for time
 -varying combinations of large sets of predictive densities that can deal w
 ith many data. The approach is based on clustering the set of predictive de
 nsities in mutually exclusive subsets and on a hierarchical specification o
 f the combination weights. This modeling strategy reduces the  dimension of
  the latent space and leads to parsimonious combinations. For efficient upd
 ating of the dynamic weights of the density combination use is made of para
 llel sequential Monte Carlo filters. We apply our proposed procedure to a l
 arge set of predictive densities using macroeconomic data and find substant
 ial gains in point and density forecasting of US real GDP\, GDP deflator in
 flation\, Treasury Bill returns and employment over the last 25 years for a
 ll horizons from 1-quarter ahead to 5-quarter head. The highest accuracy is
  achieved when the four series are predicted simultaneously using our combi
 nation schemes with within and across cluster weights based on log score le
 arning. Furthermore\, we found that weights within clusters are very volati
 le\, indicating that individual model performances are very unstable\, stre
 ngthening the use of  density combinations. Finally\, we show that the GPU 
 algorithm can reduce the computing time with respect to CPU version of seve
 ral multiples of CPU time.

 \nNonparametric Estimation of Probability Density Functions for Irregularly
  Observed Spatial Data\n\n\nAbstract:\nNonparametric estimation of probabil
 ity density functions\, both marginal and joint\ndensities\, is a very usef
 ul tool in statistical and econometric modelling and computation. The kerne
 l method is popular and applicable to dependent data\, including time serie
 s and spatial data. But at least for the joint density\, one has had to ass
 ume that data are observed at regular time intervals or on a regular grid i
 n space. Though this is not very restrictive in the time series case\, it o
 ften is in the spatial case. In fact\, to a large degree it has precluded a
 pplications of nonparametric methods to statistical and econometric modelli
 ng and computation for spatial data because such data often are irregularly
  positioned over space.\n\nIn this paper\, we propose nonparametric kernel 
 estimators for both the marginal and in particular the joint probability de
 nsity functions for non-gridded spatial data. Large sample distributions of
  the proposed estimators are established under mild conditions\, and a new 
 framework of expanding-domain infill asymptotics is suggested to overcome t
 he shortcomings of spatial asymptotics in the existing literature. A practi
 cal\, reasonable selection of the bandwidths on the basis of cross-validati
 on is also proposed. We illustrate by both simulations and real data exampl
 es of moderate sample size that the proposed methodology is effective and u
 seful in uncovering nonlinear spatial dependence for general\, including no
 n-Gaussian\, distributions.\n\nThis is a joint work with Dag Tjostheim. The
  financial supports from the Australian Research Council are acknowledged.

 r><br>The U.S. opioid crisis is now driven by fentanyl\, a powerful synthet
 ic opioid that currently<br>accounts for 90% of all opioid deaths. Fentanyl
  is smuggled from abroad\, with little evidence<br>on how this happens. We 
 show that fentanyl smuggling occurs via legal trade flows\, with<br>a posit
 ive relationship between state-level imports and drug overdoses that accoun
 ts for<br>15\,000-20\,000 deaths per year. This relationship is not explain
 ed by geographic differences<br>in “deaths of despair\,” general demand for
  opioids\, or job losses from import competition.<br>Our results suggest th
 at fentanyl smuggling via imports is pervasive and a key determinant<br>of 
 opioid problems.<br><br>Kind regards<br>Shanika\, Dan and Bonsoo

 : \nEstimates of Returns to Scale\, Elasticity of Substitution and the Thri
 fty Food Plan Meal Poverty Rate From a Direct Household Meal Production Fun
 ction\n\nAbstract:\nMany nutritional policies are designed to make home foo
 d production more affordable and yet very little is actually known about th
 e home food production process. A better understanding of home food product
 ion can be used to help explain shortcomings in current nutrition policies 
 and consequently help in designing better nutrition policies. This paper pr
 ovides results from several home meal production function specifications th
 at are rather robust. The median returns to scale and elasticity of substit
 ution between money and time is in the 1.2 to 1.9 range and .33 to .56 rang
 e\, respectively\, indicating increasing returns to scale but difficulty in
  substituting money for time in home meal production. A home ‘meal poverty 
 rate’ is estimated\, which is the percentage of the sample that produces fe
 wer meals at home than consistent with dietary guidelines. The estimated ho
 me meal poverty rate is about 85%\, which is consistent with recent researc
 h taking a less rigorous approach. Though the approach taken here is novel\
 , the overall message is consistent with the recent literature: time is a m
 ore important factor in achieving nutritional targets than money.

 Title:\nNonparametric Panel Data Models with Penalized Splines\n\nAbstract:
 \nIn this paper\, we first study estimation of nonparametric fixed\neffects
  models using penalized splines. We define a "within"\, a\n"dummy variable"
  and a “difference” estimator and show the\nequivalence of the dummy variab
 le and the within estimator\nwhich can be used as an argument for consisten
 cy of the\ndummy variable estimator when the effects are correlated with\nr
 egressors. We also study nonparametric random effects\nmodels with penalize
 d splines and prove nonparametric\ncounterparts to a variety of the relatio
 ns between parametric\nfixed and random effects estimators. We also discuss
 \nasymptotic properties of the estimators. Another feature of the\napproach
  followed in this paper is the potential to estimate\nmodels with heterosce
 dasticity and autocorrelation in the error\nterm without difficulty. We pro
 vide a simulation experiment to\nillustrate the performance of the estimato
 rs.

DESCRIPTION:Title: \nCopula based factorization in bayesian multivariate in
 finite mixture models\n\nAbstract: \nBayesian nonparametric models based on
  infinite mixtures of density kernels have been recently gaining in popular
 ity due to their flexibility and feasibility of implementation even in comp
 licated modeling scenarios. In economics\, they have been particularly usef
 ul in estimating nonparametric distributions of latent variables. However\,
  these models have been rarely applied in more than one dimension. Indeed\,
  the multivariate case suffers from the curse of dimensionality\, with a ra
 pidly increasing number of parameters needed to jointly characterize each m
 ixing component. In this paper\, we propose a factorization scheme for nonp
 arametric mixture models whereby each marginal dimension in the mixing para
 meter space is modeled separately\, linked by a nonparametric random copula
  function. Specifically\, we consider nonparametric univariate Gaussian mix
 tures for the marginals and a multivariate random Bernstein polynomial copu
 la for the link function\, under Dirichlet process priors. We show that thi
 s scheme leads to an improvement in the precision of a density estimate in 
 finite samples\, providing a suitable tool for applications in higher dimen
 sions. We derive weak posterior consistency of the copula-based mixing sche
 me for general kernel types under high-level conditions\, and strong poster
 ior consistency for the specific Bernstein-Gaussian mixture model.

 odel that arises from the artificial neural networks literature. As a model
  for statistical inference\, it may be viewed as a multivariate extension o
 f the familiar Bernoulli distribution\, within the exponential family of di
 stributions. Using the fully-visible Boltzmann machine\, it is possible to 
 fit networks of interactions between interacting binary random variables. U
 nfortunately\, direct maximum likelihood estimation is made difficult due t
 o an awkward and computationally inconvenient normalisation coefficient. A 
 maximum pseudolikelihood approach may be used to alleviate this computation
 al problem\, making the estimation of fully-visible Boltzmann machines feas
 ible.

 del to describe the  \nnonlinear trending phenomenon in panel data analysis
  and it allows  \nfor the cross-sectional dependence in both the regressors
  and the  \nresiduals. A profile likelihood approach based on the first-sta

 the cross-sectional size N tend to infinity simultaneously\, the  \nresulti
 ng semiparametric estimator of the parameter vector is  \nasymptotically no
 rmal with a rate of convergence of root-NT.  \nMeanwhile\, an asymptotic di
 stribution for a nonparametric estimate of  \nthe nonlinear time trend func

DESCRIPTION:Marginally-calibrated deep distributional regression\n\nDeep ne
 ural network (DNN) regression models are widely used in applications\nrequi
 ring state-of-the-art predictive accuracy. However\, until recently\nthere 
 has been little work on accurate uncertainty quantification for\nprediction
 s from such models. We add to this literature by outlining an\napproach to 
 constructing predictive distributions that are `marginally\ncalibrated'. Th
 is is where the long run average of the predictive\ndistributions of the re
 sponse variable matches the observed empirical\nmargin. Our approach consid
 ers a DNN regression with a conditionally\nGaussian prior for the final lay
 er weights\, from which an implicit copula\nprocess on the feature space is
  extracted. This copula process is combined\nwith a non-parametrically esti
 mated marginal distribution for the response.\nThe end result is a scalable
  distributional DNN regression method with\nmarginally calibrated predictio
 ns\, and our work complements existing methods\nfor probability calibration
 . The approach is first illustrated using two\napplications of dense layer 
 feed-forward neural networks. However\, our main\nmotivating applications a
 re in likelihood-free inference\, where\ndistributional deep regression is 
 used to estimate marginal posterior\ndistributions. In two complex ecologic
 al time series examples we employ the\nimplicit copulas of convolutional ne
 tworks\, and show that marginal\ncalibration results in improved uncertaint
 y quantification. Our approach\nalso avoids the need for manual specificati
 on of summary statistics\, a\nrequirement that is burdensome for users and 
 typical of competing\nlikelihood-free inference methods.

DESCRIPTION:Title: "GMM Estimation of Parameters of Generalised Beta Distri
 bution using Limited/Aggregate Data\n With applications to the Measurement 
 of Regional and Global Inequality."\n\nIn this paper we develop a GMM proce
 dure for estimating a generalized beta class of income distributions (GB2\,
  beta-2\, Singh-Maddala and Dagum) when we have grouped data with unknown g
 roup bounds. The approach enables us to obtain standard errors for the esti
 mated parameters and any functions of the parameters (for example\, inequal
 ity and poverty measures) and to test the validity of the assumed distribut
 ion using J-test statistics. The results shows that GB2 fits data very well

 ons<br><br><b>Abstract:&nbsp\;</b>We provide novel bounds on average treatm
 ent effects (on the treated) that are valid under an unconfoundedness assum
 ption. Our bounds are applicable if the conditioning variables do not satis
 fy the overlap condition\, are high-dimensional\, and take on a large numbe
 r of different values in the observed sample. This robustness is achieved b
 y only using limited ``pooling'' of information across observations. Namely
 \, the bounds are constructed as sample averages over functions of the obse
 rved outcomes such that the contribution of each outcome only depends on th
 e treatment status of a limited number of observations. No information pool
 ing across observations leads to so-called ``Manski bounds''\, while unlimi
 ted information pooling leads to standard inverse propensity score weightin
 g. We explore the intermediate range between these two extremes and provide
  corresponding inference methods.<br><br><br>This is a one-hour seminar\, w

DESCRIPTION:Title: \nAsymptotic redundance results for the use of GLS detre
 nding in panel unit root testing\n\nAbstract: \nOne of the most well-known 
 facts about unit root testing is that the Dickey–Fuller test based on OLS d
 etrended data suffers from low power\, and that the use of GLS detrending c
 an lead to substantial power gains. The present paper shows how the use of 
 GLS rather than OLS detrended data when testing for a unit root in panels n
 ot only leads to reduced power\, but actually has an order effect on the ne
 ighborhood around unit for which local asymptotic power is negligible.

DESCRIPTION:Title: "A Factor-analytic Random-Coefficients Model to Uncover 
 Audience Preferences for Concert Features from Ticket Sales"\n\nAbstract: T
 o better plan their programs\, producers of performing arts events need for
 ecasting models that relate ticket sales to the features of a program.  The
  framework we develop\, test and implement uncovers audience preferences fo
 r the features of an event program from ticket sales\, while accounting for
  interactions among program features and for preference heterogeneity acros
 s markets. We develop a factor-analytic random-coefficients model that over
 comes three major methodological challenges.  First\, the historical data a
 vailable from each market is limited\, preventing the estimation of statist
 ical models at the market level\, and requiring some form of shrinkage esti
 mator that also takes into account the diversity in preferences across mark
 ets. However\, preferences for the many (26 in our application) program fea
 tures are likely correlated across markets\, requiring the estimation of a 
 large covariance matrix for these preferences across markets.  We propose a
  factor-analytic regression formulation that parsimoniously captures the pr
 incipal components of the correlated preferences and provides shrinkage est
 imates at the individual market level.\n\nThe second methodological challen
 ge is that program features are likely to interact requiring the estimation
  of a large set of pair-wise interactions.  We solve this problem by mappin
 g the interactions on a reduced space\, arriving at a more parsimonious mod
 el formulation.  The third methodological challenge relates to implementati
 on of the model results beyond the relatively small sample of markets for w
 hich historical data was available. To overcome this limitation\, we demons
 trate how our model can be applied to markets not included in our sample\, 
 first using only managerial insight regarding the similarity between the fo
 cal market and the ones in our sample and by updating this subjective prior
  as ticket sales data become available.\n\n<a href="http://www.fuqua.duke.e

DESCRIPTION:Title: OLS and IV estimation of regression models including end
 ogenous interaction terms\n\nAbstract: \n\nWe analyze a class of linear reg
 ression models including interactions of endogenous regressors and exogenou
 s covariates. We show that\, under typical conditions regarding higher-orde
 r dependencies between endogenous and exogenous regressors\, the OLS estima
 tor of the coefficient of the interaction term is consistent and asymptotic
 ally normally distributed. Applying heteroskedasticity-consistent covarianc
 e matrix estimators\, we then show that standard inference based on OLS is 
 valid for the coefficient of the interaction term. Furthermore\, we analyze
  several IV estimators\, and show that an implementation assuming exogeneit
 y of the interaction term is valid under fairly weak conditions. In the mor
 e general case\, we derive that instruments need to be interacted with the 
 exogenous part of the interaction to achieve identification. Finally\, we p
 ropose several specification tests to empirically assess the validity of OL
 S and IV inference for the interaction model. Using our theoretical results
  we confirm recent empirical findings on the nonlinear causal relation betw
 een financial development and economic growth.

 This is the first study to evaluate the effects of earlypension withdrawal 
 policies on tenures on unemployment payments in the COVID-19context. We use
  a novel set of linked whole of-population administrativerecords to examine
  more than half-a-million Australians who found themselvesnewly on an unemp
 loyment payment in the initial months of the COVID-19pandemic. We estimate 
 that receiving a lump sum of up to A$10\,000 fromsuperannuation accounts at
  the most acute phase of the pandemic\, between Apriland June 2020\, result
 ed in a 32 per cent lower exit rate from unemploymentbenefits inside the fi
 rst six months of a spell on benefits\, and 14 per centinside a year of spe
 ll. Receiving a lump sum during the second window ofopportunity – mostly in
  July and August 2020 and as a labour market recoverywas underway – resulte
 d in a 34 per cent lower exit from unemployment benefitsinside the first ni
 ne months of spell\, and 14 per cent inside fifteen months ofspell. The job
 seeking deterrence is ultimately temporary but it took close toeighteen mon
 ths for an estimated convergence between withdrawers and those thatdidn’t w
 ithdraw. 162\,000 withdrawers with completed spells on average spent anaddi
 tional 7 weeks on unemployment payments\, translating to 8 millionadditiona
 l days in aggregate\, and implying A$580 million in additional pandemicfisc
 al expenditure.</p><b>Speaker Bio</b>:<i>&nbsp\;</i>Robert Breunig is the d

 nTitle:\nReturns to Education and Rural Migrant Wage Differentials in China
 : IV Quantile Treatment Effects\n \nAbstract:\nThis article presents new ev
 idence on urban-rural migrant wage differentials of workers in full-time em
 ployment in China. It utilises a nationally representative data set\, recen
 t matching techniques\, and IV estimation methods to evaluate conditional a
 nd unconditional quantile treatment effects for education and for migrant s
 tatus. Particular attention is paid to rural-migrant wage differentials and
  the migration effect on earnings. The evidence indicates that (1) the retu
 rns to education are significant\, especially when we account for endogenei
 ty\; (2) long-term migrants seem disadvantaged\, mainly due to endowment ef
 fects\, and (3) the urban-rural migrant wage gap completely disappears when
  matching or IV methods are employed to account for endogeneity in educatio
 n.\n\nThe paper appears in China Economic Review: http://www.sciencedirect.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Reputation and Choice of Hospitals for Giving Birth\n\nA
 bstract: This paper studies the role of reputation effects in individual ho
 spital selection. Our analysis focuses on birth episodes in the Melbourne m
 etropolitan area from 2011/12. We examine the decision behaviour of pregnan
 t women with private health insurance in choosing one of 18 local hospitals
 . We evaluate the importance of hospital reputation through two separate st
 rands of analysis. Firstly\, we examine the distance patients travel betwee
 n their home and the chosen clinic. In the second part of the paper we esti
 mate the probability of individual hospitals being visited. We find signifi
 cant clinic specific differences in the willingness to travel\, which sugge
 sts that patients travel further to attend more reputable institutions. Thi
 s result is complemented by substantial variation in the likelihood of indi
 vidual hospitals being chosen. These differences are predominantly linked t
 o hospital criteria and performance indicators.

 al model (black-box or otherwise) as part of the prior distribution\, formu
 lated as the “melded prior.” Literature on Bayesian melding is well-establi
 shed for deterministic mathematical models. For the stochastic case\, such 
 as some agent based models\, formal derivation of the melded prior had been
  lacking. We propose a solution and apply it to an existing stochastic agen
 t based model. To allow flexible formulations of likelihoods without sacrif
 icing computational efficiency\, we employ an emulator alongside a posterio
 r sampling algorithm that embeds sampling-importance-resampling within Metr
 opolis-Hastings. The bulk of this joint work (in progress) appears in Dawki
 ns (2017) (ANU Honours Thesis co-supervised by G. Chiu and A. Westveld).</f

 ic: Assessing the Effectiveness of Mobile Phone Promotions\n\nAbstract: A s
 tart-up interactive media company in Melbourne\, Australia\, conducted a tw
 o-year trial in a shopping mall in which about 5\,500 people were recruited
  to a panel whereby an RFID tag was attached to their mobile phone. They al
 l opted-in to receive 3 SMS coupons whenever they “swiped” their mobile pho
 ne at the mall entrances. Over 150\,000 promotional messages were delivered
  during the trial\, comprising 40 stores that generated 136 different SMS c
 oupons.  We develop a tri-variate probit model with person and store random
  effects and estimate the parameters using MCMC estimation. Our findings sh
 ow there is only about a 1% redemption rate for the coupons. However\, many
  of the covariates are significant\, showing\, for example\, that snack foo
 d promotions are much more successful than men’s clothing. Items of low val
 ue\, such as milkshakes and pancakes have much higher redemption rates than
  shoes and women’s hairdressing. “2 for 1” offers do much better than perce
 ntage or dollar discounts. There is also an important store location effect
  whereby the shorter the distance from the swipe point to the store the mor
 e likely a person is to redeem the coupon. Lastly\, there are large heterog
 eneity effects\, with previous redeemers being much more likely to redeem i
 n the future (people we term “promo junkies”).

DESCRIPTION:<b>Title:</b> A regime-switching stochastic volatility model fo
 r forecasting electricity prices<br><br><b>Abstract:</b> This paper address
 es three crucial challenges outstanding in the area of electricity price fo
 recasting. Specifically\, we show the importance of considering fundamental
  price drivers in modelling\, develop new techniques for probabilistic (i.e
 . interval or density) forecasting of electricity prices\, and introduce a 
 universal Bayesian technique for model comparison. We propose a new regime-
 switching stochastic volatility model with three regimes\, which may be int
 erpreted as negative jump or “drop”\, normal price or “base”\, and positive
  jump or “spike”\, respectively. The transition matrix between these regime
 s is allowed to depend on explanatory variables in a novel way\, using an u
 nderlying ordered probit model. Bayesian inference is employed in order to 
 obtain predictive densities. The main focus of the paper is on short-term d
 ensity forecasting in the Nord Pool intraday market. We show that the propo
 sed model outperforms several benchmark models at this task\, as measured b
 y their predictive Bayes factors. In particular\, the incorporation of stoc
 hastic volatility\, regime switching\, information from the day-ahead marke
 t\, and exogenous information from weather reports into the model are all s
 hown to improve its predictive performance\, without falling prey to curse 
 of dimensionality problems.

 erest\ncontains two sets of explanatory variables which economic theory\npr
 edicts may be endogenous. The researcher is interested in testing\nthe exog
 eneity of only one of them. Standard exogeneity tests are in\ngeneral unrel
 iable from the view point of size control to assess such\na problem. We dev
 elop four alternative tests to address this issue in\na convenient way. We 
 provide a characterization of their distributions\nunder both the null hypo
 thesis (level) and the alternative hypothesis\n(power)\, with or without id
 entification. We show that the usual\nchi-squared critical values are still
  applicable even when\nidentification is weak. So\, all proposed tests can 
 be described as\nrobust to weak instruments. We also show that test consist
 ency may\nstill hold even if the overall identification fails\, provided pa
 rtial\nidentification is satisfied. We present a Monte Carlo experiment whi
 ch\nconfirms our theory. We illustrate our theory with the widely\nconsider

 \, and (2) the relevance of using our procedures when\nchecking for partial

DESCRIPTION:Title: \nAnalysing Occupancy Surveys\n\nAbstract:\nOccupancy su
 rveys are surveys of sites which are designed to collect data for the purpo
 se of either estimating the proportion of sites that are occupied or modell
 ing the probability that a site is occupied by a particular animal species.
    The standard approach (MacKenzie et al\, 2006) recognises that the binar
 y occupancy variable may be measured with error\, assuming particularly tha
 t a site may be occupied without the species being detected on the site.  T
 his situation is handled by assuming that the occupancy status of a site do
 es not change over a period of time and then making multiple visits to at l
 east some sites over that period.  Data collected in this way can then be u
 sed to model the probability of detection and hence to adjust the estimates
  of occupancy for potential nondetection. \n\nWe show that occupancy models
  are more difficult to fit than is generally appreciated because the estima
 ting equations often have multiple solutions\, including boundary estimates
  which produce fitted probabilities of zero or one.  The estimates are unst
 able when the data are sparse\, making them difficult to interpret\, and\, 
 even in ideal situations\, highly variable.  As a consequence\, making accu
 rate inference is difficult.  When abundance varies over sites (which is th
 e general rule in ecology because we expect spatial variance in abundance) 
 and detection depends on abundance\, the standard analysis suffers bias (at
 tenuation in detection\, biased estimates of occupancy and potentially find
 ing misleading relationships between occupancy and other covariates)\, asym
 metric sampling distributions\, and slow convergence of the sampling distri
 butions to normality.  The biases are of similar magnitude to those obtaine
 d when we ignore non-detection entirely. The fact that abundance is subject
  to detection error and hence is not directly observable\, means that we ca
 nnot tell when bias is present and we cannot adjust for it.  This implies t
 hat trying to adjust occupancy models for non-detection can be as misleadin
 g as ignoring non-detection completely.\n\nThis is joint work with D.B. Lin
 demayer  and C.F. Donnelly

 ample size (n). We illustrate the usefulness of our proposed estimation met
 hod via Monte Carlo simulations and an application to real data.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Jump Detection in Generalized Error-in-variables Regress
 ion with an Application to Australian Health Tax Policies\n\nAbstract: With
 out measurement errors in predictors\, discontinuity of a non-parametric re
 gression function at unknown locations could be estimated using a number of
  existing approaches. However\, it becomes a challenging problem when the p
 redictors contain measurement errors. In this paper\, an error-in-variables
  jump point estimator is suggested for a nonparametric generalized error-in
 -variables regression model. A major feature of our method is that it does 
 not impose any parametric distribution on the measurement error. Its perfor
 mance is evaluated by both numerical studies and theoretical justifications
 . The method is applied to studying the impact of Medicare Levy Surcharge o
 n the private health insurance take-up rate in Australia.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Improving mean-variance portfolio strategy using multipl
 e graphical models\n \nAbstract: The inverse covariance matrix plays a cruc
 ial role in portfolio risk minimization\, as it prescribes the hedge trades
  in which a stock is hedged by all the other stocks in the portfolio. In pr
 actice with finite samples\, however\, the estimation errors in the inverse
  covariance matrix make the hedge trades too unstable and unreliable. In th
 is project\, built upon the recent advances in multiple graphical models\, 
 a “shrink” estimator of the inverse covariance matrix is proposed to handle
  these estimation errors with the goal of improving the performance of mean
 -variance portfolio. The proposed estimator is constructed by simultaneousl
 y shrinking the number of stocks involved in each “rolling” estimation wind
 ow\, as well as shrinking the time-variation of the inverse covariance esti
 mators across different estimation windows. The out-of-sample performance o
 f portfolios formed on the proposed estimator is also examined throughout c
 omparing with other existing methods (equal weighting\, industry factor mod
 el\, short-sales and turnover constraints\, shrunk covariance matrix (const
 ructed for each estimation window separately)).

 tract: We propose a model of dynamic trading where a strategic high frequen
 cy trader receives an imperfect signal about the future order flow\, and ex
 ploits his speed advantage to act as a market maker. We determine the provi
 sion of liquidity\, order cancellations\, and impact on low frequency trade
 rs. The model predicts that volatility leads high frequency traders to redu
 ce their provision of liquidity. Next\, we analyze the problem when the hig
 h frequency trader competes with another market maker. Finally\, we provide
  the first formal\, model-based analysis of the impact of various policies 
 designed to regulate high frequency trading.\n\nLink: http://papers.ssrn.co

 ke automated decisions for people from different protected groups. When ind
 ividuals are classified\, the decision errors can be unfairly concentrated 
 in certain protected groups. We develop a fairness-adjusted selective infer
 ence (FASI) framework and data-driven algorithms that achieve statistical p
 arity in the sense that the false selection rate (FSR) is controlled and eq
 ualized among protected groups. The FASI algorithm operates by converting t
 he outputs from black-box classifiers to R-values\, which are intuitively a
 ppealing and easy to compute. Selection rules based on R-values are provabl
 y valid for FSR control\, and avoid disparate impacts on protected groups. 
 The effectiveness of FASI is demonstrated through both simulated and real d

DESCRIPTION:Title: "Estimating economic impact using ex post econometric an
 alysis: Cautionary tales"\n\nAbstract: This paper provides an overview of t
 echniques that can be used to estimate the economic impact of stadiums\, ev
 ents\, championships\, and franchises on local economies. Utilizing data fr
 om National Collegiate Athletic Association championships\, this paper high
 lights the potential problems that can be made if city and time effects are
  not handled and unit-roots are not accounted for. In addition\, the paper 
 describes the technique for estimating dynamic panel data and the advantage
 s that come with these modeling techniques.

DESCRIPTION:Title:\n\nStructural Vector Autoregressions with Smooth Transit
 ion in Variances: The Interaction Between U.S. Monetary Policy and the Stoc
 k Market\n\nAbstract:\n\nIn structural vector autoregressive analysis ident
 ifying the shocks of interest via heteroskedasticity has become a standard 
 tool. Unfortunately\, the approaches currently used for modelling heteroske
 dasticity all have drawbacks. For instance\, assuming known dates for varia
 nce changes is often unrealistic while more flexible models based on GARCH 
 or Markov switching residuals are difficult to handle from a statistical an
 d computational point of view. Therefore we propose a model based on a smoo
 th change in variance that is flexible as well as relatively easy to estima
 te. The model is applied to a five-dimensional system of U.S. variables to 
 explore the interaction between monetary policy and the stock market. It is
  found that previously used conventional identification schemes in this con
 text are rejected by the data if heteroskedasticity is allowed for. Shocks 
 identified via heteroskedasticity have a different economic interpretation 
 than the shocks identified using conventional methods.

 potential link between RSM and the Shapley value decomposition (SVD) using 
 the US GDP growth rates. This technique combination enables handling high-d
 imensional data and reveals the relative importance of each individual fore
 cast. First\, it is possible to enhance forecasting performance in certain 
 practical instances by randomly selecting smaller subsets of individual for
 ecasts and obtaining a new set of predictions based on a regression-based w
 eighting scheme. The optimal value of selected individual forecasts is also
  empirically studied. Then\, a connection between RSM and SVD is proposed\,
  enabling the examination of each individual forecast’s contribution to the
  final prediction\, even when there is a large number of forecasts. This ap
 proach is model-agnostic (can be applied to any set of predictions) and fac
 ilitates understanding of how the aggregated prediction is obtained based o
 n individual forecasts\, which is crucial for decision-makers.<br><br>Kind

DESCRIPTION:Infinite Order Cross-Validated Local Polynomial Regression\n\nA
 bstract: \nMany practical problems require nonparametric estimates of regre
 ssion functions\, and local polynomial regression has emerged as a leading 
 approach. In applied settings practitioners often adopt either the local co
 nstant or local linear variants\, or choose the order of the local polynomi
 al to be slightly greater than the order of the maximum derivative estimate
  required. But such ad hoc determination of the polynomial order may not be
  optimal in general\, while the joint determination of the polynomial order
  and bandwidth presents some interesting theoretical and practical challeng
 es. In this paper we propose a data-driven approach towards the joint deter
 mination of the polynomial order and bandwidth\, provide theoretical underp
 innings\, and demonstrate that improvements in both finite-sample efficienc
 y and rates of convergence can thereby be obtained. In the case where the t
 rue data generating process (DGP) is in fact a polynomial whose order does 
 not depend on the sample size\, our method is capable of attaining the √n r
 ate often associated with correctly specified parametric models\, while the
  estimator is shown to be uniformly consistent for a much larger class of D
 GPs. Theoretical underpinnings are provided and finite-sample properties ar
 e examined.

DESCRIPTION:Abstract:<br>\nIn this paper\, we consider the semiparametric e
 stimation of a \npartially linear single-index panel data model with fixed 
 effects.\nWithout taking the difference explicitly\, we propose using the \
 nsemiparametric minimum average variance estimation (SMAVE) based on \nthe 
 dummy variable method to remove the fixed effects and obtain the \nestimato
 rs for the parameters and the unknown link function. As both \nthe cross-se

 blish the asymptotic normality of the proposed estimators \nof the paramete
 rs involved in the single index as well as the linear \ncomponent of the mo
 del\, but also obtain an asymptotic distribution for \nthe nonparametric lo
 cal linear estimator of the unknown link function. \nThe asymptotic distrib
 utions for the proposed estimators are similar \nto those obtained for the 
 random effects case.\nFurthermore\, we also study a dynamic partially linea

 consolidated geographically over the period 1988-2007. This consolidation w
 as slow and therefore we seek to learn the role of FCC policy in affecting 
 the speed of geographic consolidation. We use the history of mergers to est

 ations that pose substantial challenges\nto econometric efforts to recover 
 the structural shocks to which economic agents react. Using\ntax policies a
 s a leading example of foresight\, simple theory makes transparent the econ

DESCRIPTION:Title:  Partial Identification Subnetwork Approach to Discrete 
 Games in Large Networks: An Application to Quantifying Peer Effects”\n\nAbs
 tract : This paper studies identification and estimation of discrete games 
 in large networks\, with an application to peer effects on smoking in frien
 d networks. Due to the presence of multiple equilibria\, the model is not p
 oint identified. We adopt the partial identification approach by constructi
 ng moment inequalities on choice probabilities of subnetworks. Doing so not
  only significantly reduces the computational cost\, but also enables us to
  find consistent estimator of the moment conditions even when the network i
 s large and the friendship relationship structure varies significantly amon
 g networks. Monte Carlo studies are conducted to evaluate the performance o
 f the subnetwork approach. In the application using the Add Health data\, w
 e find significant and positive peer effects on smoking.

DESCRIPTION:Title: \nImproving forecasting by estimating time series struct
 ural components across multiple frequencies\n\nAbstract: \nIdentifying the 
 appropriate time series model to achieve good forecasting accuracy and bias
  is not straightforward. We propose a novel algorithm that aims to mitigate
  the importance of model selection\, while increasing accuracy. From the or
 iginal time series\, using temporal aggregation\, multiple time series are 
 constructed. These derivative series highlight different aspects of the ori
 ginal data\, as temporal aggregation helps in strengthening or attenuating 
 the signals of different time series components. In each series the appropr
 iate exponential smoothing method is fitted and its respective time series 
 components are forecasted. Subsequently\, the time series components from e
 ach aggregation level are combined\, and then used to construct the final f
 orecast. This approach achieves better estimation of the different time ser
 ies components\, through temporal aggregation and mitigates the importance 
 of model selection through forecast combination. Empirical evaluation of th
 e proposed framework demonstrates significant improvements in forecasting a
 ccuracy and bias\, especially for long-term forecasts.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Inference for GMM under Misspecification\n\nAbstract: Th
 is paper develops a new distribution theory and inference methods for over-
 identified Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimation focusing on the i
 terated GMM estimator\, allowing for moment misspecification\, and for clus
 tered dependence with heterogeneous and growing cluster sizes. This paper i
 s the first to provide a rigorous theory for the iterated GMM estimator. We
  provide conditions for its existence by demonstrating that the iteration s
 equence is a contraction mapping. Our asymptotic theory allows the moments 
 to be possibly misspecified\, which is a general feature of approximate ove
 r-identified models. This form of moment misspecification causes bias in co
 nventional standard error estimation. Our results show how to correct for t
 his standard error bias. Our paper is also the first to provide a rigorous 
 distribution theory for the GMM estimator under cluster dependence. Our dis
 tribution theory is asymptotic\, and allows for heterogeneous and growing c
 luster sizes. Our results cover standard smooth moment condition models\, i
 ncluding dynamic panels\, which is a common application for GMM with cluste
 r dependence. Our simulation results show that conventional heteroskedastic
 ity-robust standard errors are highly biased under moment misspecification\
 , severely understating estimation uncertainty\, and resulting in severely 
 over-sized hypothesis tests. In contrast\, our misspecification-robust stan
 dard errors are approximately unbiased and properly sized under both correc
 t specification and misspecification. We illustrate the method by extending
  the empirical work reported in Acemoglu\, Johnson\, Robinson\, and Yared (
 2008\, American Economic Review) and Cervellati\, Jung\, Sunde\, and Vische
 r (2014\, American Economic Review). Our results reveal an enormous effect 
 of iterating the GMM estimator\, demonstrating the arbitrariness of using o
 ne-step and two-step estimators. Our results also show a large effect of us
 ing misspecification robust standard errors instead of the Arellano-Bond st
 andard errors. Our results support Acemoglu\, Johnson\, Robinson\, and Yare
 d's conclusion of an insignificant effect of income on democracy\, but reve
 al that the heterogeneous effects documented by Cervellati\, Jung\, Sunde\,
  and Vischer are less statistically significant than previously claimed.\n\

DESCRIPTION:Title: “Identification using stability restrictions”\n \nAbstra
 ct: Structural change\, typically induced by policy regime shifts\, is a co
 mmon feature of dynamic economic models. We show that structural change can
  be used constructively to improve the identification of structural paramet
 ers that are stable over time. A leading example is models that are immune 
 to the well-known Lucas (1976) critique. This insight is used to develop no
 vel econometric methods that extend the widely used generalized  method of 
 moments (GMM). The proposed methods yield improved inference on the paramet

DESCRIPTION:Title:  Agriculture\, Nutrition and the Green Revolution in Ban
 gladesh\n\nAbstract: \n\nThis paper analyzes agriculture and nutrition link
 ages in Bangladesh\, a country that achieved rapid growth in rice productiv
 ity at a relatively late stage in Asia’s Green Revolution\, as well as unhe
 ralded progress against undernutrition. To do so we create a synthetic pane
 l that aggregates nutritional data from five rounds of the Demographic Heal
 th Surveys (1997 to 2011) with district-level estimates of rice yields. Usi
 ng various panel estimators\, we find rice yields significantly explain wei
 ght gain in young children\, but not linear growth. We further show that ri
 ce yields have large and positive effects on the timely introduction of com
 plementary foods for young children\, but not on dietary diversity indicato
 rs\, and that this complementary feeding indicator is positively associated
  with child weight gain but not with linear growth. The reverse holds for d
 ietary diversity indicators. The results therefore suggest that Bangladesh’
 s Green Revolution has made a large contribution to improvements in weight 
 gain\, but had little effect on postnatal linear growth. Achieving the latt
 er would appear to require greater efforts to diversify diets out of cereal
 s and into more micronutrient-rich foods.

DESCRIPTION:Title: International macro-financial linkages matter: estimatin
 g finance-adjusted output gaps in G7 countries\n\nAbstract: We estimate fin
 ance neutral potential output and the corresponding output gaps for the G7 
 countries. Each country's output gap is driven by a global macro and a glob
 al macro-financial cycle\, as well as country specific factors in macro and
  financial variables. To this end\, we develop an international multivariat
 e unobserved components model to disentangle real GDP\, credit and house pr
 ices in their trend and cyclical components. The latter are modeled as a dy
 namic factor model\, which allows us to identify global factors in real GDP
  and the financial variables. The ‘globally’ finance-adjusted output gaps s
 how patterns of overheating prior to the financial crisis and they tend to 
 be negative for a longer period after the crisis when compared to a benchma
 rk output gap. A variance decomposition reveals that the global macro-finan
 cial cycle and also country-specific macro-finance factors are major driver
 s of the output gaps in the G7 countries.

  develops a novel econometric test to evaluate the effects of an unobservab
 le factor on choice among multiple alternatives -specifically\, marriage pr

 tor affects both individual decision-making and a binary outcome variable\,
  posing challenges for identification. Employing a copula-based estimation 
 that leverages the ordered utilities within a polychotomous choice framewor
 k\, we find that marriage prospects significantly influence major selection
  among participants in the National Longitudinal Study of Youth (97). Furth
 ermore\, we validate the robustness of our findings with alternative tests 
 that use stated marriage expectation measures from our data\, thereby demon
 strating the applicability and validity of our testing procedure in real-li
 fe scenarios.<br><br>Bio: Professor Li’s primary research and teaching inte

DESCRIPTION:Title: “Quantile Regressions for Fractional Integration Testing
 : A case of realized volatility”\n\nAbstract:\n\nIn this paper we propose a
  quantile regression based test to detect long memory that extends the Lagr
 ange Multiplier test by Breitung and Hassler (2002\, Journal of Econometric
 s). First\, the new procedure is more powerful under outliers or leptokurti
 c distributions. Second\, it allows to detect whether the degree of memory 
 or fractional integration varies at different quantiles\, which is particul
 arly useful when one is interested in the tail-behavior of the data. The te
 st is straightforward to apply since the limiting distribution is Gaussian 
 or \\chi^2 and free of nuisance parameters. The validity in finite samples 
 is established through Monte Carlo experiments. The application to daily re
 alized volatility produces new insights into the widely accepted long-memor
 y feature: The model with a constant order of integration is rejected due t
 o persistence growing with increasing quantiles.\n\n<a href="http://www.wiw

 <br><br><b>Title</b>: Uniform Inference in Linear Panel Data Models with Tw
 o-Dimensional Heterogeneity<br><br><b>Abstract</b>: This paper studies unif
 orm inference in linear panel data models when the slope coefficients may e
 xhibit heterogeneity over both the time and individual dimensions and conve
 ntional fixed effects estimators may fail to be consistent. We decompose th
 e slope coefficient vector into a common component\, an individual heteroge
 neity component and a time heterogeneity component. Due to the fact that on
 e can not eliminate either the individual or time heterogeneity in the slop
 e coefficients through the usual demeaning or differencing procedure and th
 at the separate estimates of the individual and time heterogeneity componen
 ts via respective time series and cross-sectional regressions are generally
  inconsistent when these components are allowed to be correlated with the r
 egressors\, we propose to generalize the fixed effects estimator to estimat
 e these three components along with the traditional individual and time fix
 ed effects in the models under suitable identification restrictions. To est
 ablish the asymptotic properties of the generalized fixed effects (GFE) est
 imators\, we invert a number of large dimensional square matrices by approx
 imating them with quasi-Kronecker structured matrices. We establish the asy
 mptotic normality of our GFE estimators by characterizing their asymptotic 
 biases and variances. The convergence rates of our estimators depend on the
  unknown degrees of individual and time heterogeneity. To make a uniform in
 ference on the common slope component\, we propose a novel triple-bootstrap
  procedure to estimate the asymptotic variance of our GFE estimators which 
 are valid uniformly over a broad space of parameter heterogeneity. Simulati
 ons show the superb performance of our estimators in various scenarios. We 
 apply our method to study the relationship between savings and investments 
 in a cross-countries study. We find significant parameter heterogeneity alo
 ng both the individual and time dimensions and provide some new insight to 
 explain the Feldstein--Horioka puzzle. &nbsp\;

DESCRIPTION:Title: Inference for Iterated GMM Under Misspecification and Cl
 ustering (with Bruce Hansen)\n\nAbstract:\nThis paper proposes simple new i
 nference methods for overidentified Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) est
 imation which correct the standard error bias which arises when moments are
  possibly misspecified. We focus on the iterated GMM estimator\, providing 
 the first rigorous demonstration of existence\, and the first distribution 
 theory for iterated GMM under moment misspecification. We show that inferen
 ce theory for overidentified GMM can be simply recast as a just-identified 
 higher-dimensional moment model\, simplifying and unifying inference method
 s. Our distribution theory is asymptotic\, allowing for either independent 
 or clustered samples. We introduce a new set of asymptotic results for clus
 tered data\, generalizing the classic laws of large numbers\, uniform laws\
 , and central limit theory\, to allow for clustered observations with heter
 ogeneous and unbounded cluster sizes. Our simulation results show that our 
 methods successfully remove the large biases in inference due to moment mis
 specification. We illustrate the method by replicating the application of A
 cemoglu\, Johnson\, Robinson\, and Yared (2008\, American Economic Review) 
 and Cervellati\, Jung\, Sunde\, and Vischer (2014\, American Economic Revie
 w) about the causal effect of income on democracy. We find that Acemoglu et
  al's conclusion is further supported but Cervellati et al's findings becom
 e insignificant when the standard errors are corrected. \n\nSeminar organis

 g dynamic factor methods. By distinguishing the Great Recession from the re
 st of the sample period\, our method identifies the financial sector as the
  epicenter during the crisis. Moreover\, different from the earlier literat
 ure that relies on input-output linkages to propagate shocks\, this study a

 <br>Abstract:&nbsp\;<br>We consider statistical inference for moments of th

 with small denominator\, A. This paper develops a method of robust inferenc
 e\, and proposes a data-driven practical choice of trimming observations wi
 th small A. Our sense of the robustness is twofold. First\, bias correction
  allows for robustness against large trimming bias. Second\, adaptive infer
 ence allows for robustness against unknown convergence rate. The proposed m
 ethod allows for closer-to-optimal trimming\, and more informative inferenc
 e results in practice. This practical advantage is demonstrated for inverse
  propensity score weighting through simulation studies.

DESCRIPTION:Forecasting with micro panels: The case of health care costs\n 
 \nAbstract: Micro panels characterized by large numbers of individuals obse
 rved over a short time period provide a rich source of information but as y
 et there is only limited experience in using such data for forecasting.  We
  exploit the linkage of a cohort-representative survey of more than 250\,00
 0 Australians aged 45 and over to several years of hospital\, medical and p
 harmaceutical records. After calculating total health care cost for each su
 rvey respondent\, we explore the relative forecasting performance of altern
 ative models of health expenditures. In contrast to much of the risk adjust
 ment literature\, where such modelling is prevalent\, the availability of p
 anel data allows the use of a fixed effects approach in order to guard agai
 nst possible omitted variable biases associated with unobservable individua
 l specific effects. This is motivated by the well-established preference fo
 r using fixed effects when parameter estimation is the main objective. Whil
 e existing simulation evidence also supports the use of a fixed effects app

 nvalid instrumental variables in linear models with unobserved confounding\
 , together with some new ideas on how to improve certain methods. As an exa
 mple\, a recent proposal by Xue et al. (JASA\, 2023) proposes a two-stage c
 onstrained maximum likelihood method. Their subset selection algorithm howe
 ver suffers from the same problems as the Lasso\, and will therefore not al
 ways select the valid instruments. I present a solution for the one-sample 
 case with a finite number of instruments.<br><br>Kind regards<br>Dan\, Ben\

DESCRIPTION:Title: "Local Government Capability and Public Spending Efficac
 y:<br/>\nEvidence from a Decentralized Government Transfer Program in Indon
 esia"\n<br>\n Abstract: This paper investigates the association between pre
 -existing local government\ncapability and the size of grants from the cent
 ral government that is actually delivered\nto intended beneficiaries by the
  local government. Combining administrative data and\nhousehold survey data
 sets\, we show that only 78 percent of the grants under the\nInpres Desa Te
 rtinggal (IDT)–Indonesia’s poverty alleviation program–were received\nby in
 tended beneficiaries. IDT’s decentralized distribution scheme suggests that
  this\nloss took place at the village level. Failing to taking this into ac
 count leads to\nmisleading conclusion about the program’s targeting perform
 ance. We find that preexisting\nadministrative and organizational skills of
  village governments are positively\nassociated with the share of funds rea
 ching beneficiaries. The results of our panel\nanalysis further reveal that
  the capability of village government became particularly\nimportant over t
 ime. To the extent that these results reflect a causal relationship\, they\
 nimply that training of local government officials is likely to reduce the 
 disappearance\nof public resources and improve public spending efficacy.\n<

   Large Pre-trained Models Achieve Near-optimal Time Series Forecasting<br>
 <br><b>Abstract</b>:<br><br>Pre-training machine learning models on large q
 uantities of data has revolutionized many fields\, but its adoption in Time
  Series Forecasting lags. It can be argued that fields such as Time Series 
 Analysis\, Signal Processing or Econometrics\, have already produced very c
 ompetitive models for time series that are difficult to outperform. In fact
 \, the most successful neural network approaches to forecasting impose some
  form of structure derived from these 'classic' models.<br><br>We propose p
 re-training neural networks on trillions of data points coming from simulat
 ions of time series models\, then run them in a zero-shot fashion on new ti
 me series. Surprisingly\, these pre-trained networks can outperform the ver
 y model families that generated the data.<br>Our research suggests they lea
 rn the underlying optimal estimation principles. For example\, they are mor
 e accurate than a Least Squares or Maximum Likelihood estimator for an ARIM
 A model when the time series has been generated by an ARIMA.<br><br>An imme
 diate benefit of this result is that pre-trained models can be deployed in 
 place of existing forecasting solutions based on known processes\, deliveri
 ng accuracy gains at orders of magnitude faster compute time (even when run
  on CPU). More importantly\, the method can approximately solve forecasting
  problems that have remained open and puzzled the forecasting community for
  decades\, such as the notorious Optimal Forecast Model Selection/Combinati
 on\, or derivation of good estimators for time series with complex uncertai
 nty structures (mixtures\, varying volatility\, extreme events) or with str
 uctural breaks. It turns out that these processes are difficult to solve an
 alytically\, but trivial to simulate from.<br><br>These pre-trained models\
 , after being trained on several orders of magnitude more data than other t
 ime series foundation models\, achieve state-of-the-art in some of the main
  forecasting benchmark datasets already off-the-shelf\, and further benefit
  from fine-tuning. We will end with a discussion of interesting challenges 
 that arise from training via simulations: what to do when we have 'infinite
  data'?<br><br>Kind regards<br>Shanika\, Dan and Bonsoo

 derstanding Regressions with Observations Collected at High Frequency over 
 Long Span<b><br></b><br><b>Abstract: </b><br>In this paper\, we analyze reg
 ressions with observations collected at small time interval over long perio
 d of time. For the formal asymptotic analysis\, we assume that samples are 
 obtained from continuous time stochastic processes\, and let the sampling i
 nterval δ shrink down to zero and the sample span T increase up to infinity
 . In this setup\, we show that the standard Wald statistic diverges to infi
 nity and the regression becomes spurious as long as δ → 0 sufficiently fast
  relative to T → ∞. Such a phenomenon is indeed what is frequently observed
  in practice for the type of regressions considered in the paper. In contra
 st\, our asymptotic theory predicts that the spuriousness disappears if we 
 use the robust version of the Wald test with an appropriate longrun varianc
 e estimate. This is supported\, strongly and unambiguously\, by our empiric
 al illustration.&nbsp\;&nbsp\;

DESCRIPTION:Time-varying VAR: a nonparametric approach\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe i
 mpulse response function (IRF) is a time-invariant function commonly used a
 s a measure of the effect of exogenous shocks on other economic variables. 
 It is calculated after the estimation of a VAR model and different versions
  of it are estimated the VAR process is time-variant. We assume that the pr
 ocess of interest is locally stationary and propose the nonparametric local
  linear estimator of a time-varying VAR. The estimates are used to obtain a
  confidence band where the IRF of such process is likely to lie.\n\nhttp://

 l studies of its loss function surface and the convergence behaviour of ite
 rative updates for optimising the loss are far from complete. In this talk\
 , we focus on the problem of community detection for a simple two-class Sto
 chastic Blockmodel (SBM) with balanced class size. Using batch co-ordinate 
 ascent (BCAVI) for updates\, we show different convergence behaviour with r
 espect to different initialisations. When the parameters are known or estim
 ated within a reasonable range and held fixed\, we characterise conditions 
 under which an initialisation can converge to the ground truth. On the othe
 r hand\, when the parameters need to be estimated iteratively\, a random in
 itialisation will converge to an uninformative local optimum.<br><br>Detail

DESCRIPTION:Title: CLASSIFICATION USING FUNCTION SCRAPS\n\nFunction scraps 
 are fragments of "whole" curves that are\, at least conceptually\, conventi
 onal random functions defined over a common domain.  In particular\, a func
 tion scrap is observed only over a subinterval of the common domain\, and t
 he subintervals are generally different for different scraps. Functional da
 ta of this type are increasingly common.  We shall suggest new methods for 
 reconstructing the whole functions\, and for building classifiers for funct
 ion scraps.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Almost Similar Tests for Mediation Effects and other Hyp
 otheses with Singularities\n\nAbstract: Testing for mediation effects is em
 pirically important and theoretically interesting. It is empirically import
 ant in psychology\, medicine\, accountancy\, and marketing for instance\, a
 nd leads to a theoretically interesting and long-standing problem in statis
 tics that this paper solves. The no-mediation effect hypothesis\, expressed
  as H₀:θ₁θ₂=0\, defines a manifold that is non-regular in the origin where 
 the size and power of standard tests\, including the Wald\, LR\, and LM tes
 ts\, are extremely low. The statistical challenge is to find a similar test
  with correct size independent of θ₁ and θ₂. We solve this problem by consi
 dering the critical region directly\, rather than defining a test statistic
  and trying to correct its critical value. We prove the interesting theoret
 ical result that no similar test exists\, even if the asymptotic normal app
 roximation is used. Despite this negative theoretical finding\, we are able
  to construct a critical region that is all but similar and can be used in 
 practice. We extend this result to three dimensions and show how it can be 
 extended to higher dimensions for null hypotheses of the form H₀:θ₁θ₂⋯=0 wi
 th singularities at the origin.

 Abstract:&nbsp\;</p><p style="">Adding multivariate stochastic volatility o
 f a flexible form to large Vector Autoregressions (VARs) involving over a h

  and over-parameterization concerns. The existing literature either works w
 ith homoskedastic models or smaller models with restrictive forms for the s
 tochastic volatility. In this paper\, we develop composite likelihood metho
 ds for large VARs with multivariate stochastic volatility. These involve es
 timating large numbers of parsimonious models and then taking a weighted av
 erage across these models. We discuss various schemes for choosing the weig
 hts. In our empirical work involving VARs of up to 196 variables\, we show 
 that composite likelihood methods forecast much better than the most popula
 r large VAR approach which is computationally practical in very high dimens
 ions: the homoskedastic VAR with Minnesota prior. We also compare our metho
 ds to various popular approaches which allow for stochastic volatility usin
 g medium and small VARs involving up to 20 variables. We find our methods t
 o forecast appreciably better than these as well.</p>Details of the seminar

DESCRIPTION:Econometric Methods for Endogenously Sampled Time Series: The C
 ase of Commodity Price Speculation in the Steel Market\n\nGeorge Hall\, Bra
 ndeis University\nJohn Rust\, Georgetown University\n\nAbstract: This paper
  studies the econometric problems associated with estimation of stochastic 
 processes that is endogenously sampled. We observe a discrete-time stochast
 ic process {pt} at a subset of times {t1\, . . . \, tn} that depend on the 
 outcome of a probabilistic sampling rule that depends on the history of the
  process as well as other observed covariates xt . We focus on a particular
  example where pt is the daily wholesale price of a standardized steel prod
 uct. There are no formal exchanges or centralized markets where steel is tr
 aded and pt can be observed. Instead nearly all steel transaction prices ar
 e a result of private bilateral negotiations\, intermediated by middlemen k
 nown as steel service centers. We observe purchases by a particular firm—a 
 steel service center that purchases large quantities of steel in the wholes
 ale market for subsequent resale at a markup in the retail market. The endo
 genous sampling problem arises from the fact that the firm only records pt 
 on the days that it purchases steel. We present a parametric analysis of th
 is problem under the assumption that the timing of steel purchases is part 
 of an optimal trading strategy that maximizes expected discounted trading p
 rofits. We derive a parametric partial information maximum likelihood (PIML
 ) estimator and an alternative consistent\, less efficient\, but computatio
 nally simpler method of simulated moments (MSM) estimator that avoids high 
 dimensional numerical integrations required by the PIML estimator. We use t
 he MSM estimator to estimate a truncated lognormal AR(1) model of the whole
 sale price processes for particular types of steel plate. We infer the shar
 e of the middleman’s discounted profits that are due to markups\, and the s
 hare due to price speculation. The latter measures the firm’s success in fo
 recasting steel prices and in timing its purchases in order to “buy low and
  sell high”. The more successful the firm is in speculation (i.e. in strate
 gically timing its purchases)\, the more serious are the potential biases t
 hat would result from failing to account for the endogeneity of the samplin
 g process. \n\nSeminar organiser: Hsein Kew

 b>This paper develops methods for the production and evaluation of censored

 recast risks in a middle region of the density covering a specified probabi

 ons. We propose a fixed-point algorithm that fits a potentially skewed and 
 fat-tailed density to the inner observations\, acknowledging that the outly

 sp\; We also introduce a new test for calibration of censored density forec
 asts. An application using historical forecast errors from the Federal Rese
 rve Board and the Monetary Policy Committee at the Bank of England suggests
  that the use of censored density functions to represent the pattern of for
 ecast errors results in much greater parameter stability than do uncensored
  densities. We illustrate the utility of censored density forecasts when qu
 antifying forecast risks after shocks such as the global financial crisis a
 nd the COVID-19 pandemic and find that\, for the United Kingdom\, these out
 perform the official forecasts produced by the MPC.<b></b></p></td></tr></t

DESCRIPTION:Title: School Performance\, Score Inflation and Neighborhood De
 velopment\n\nAbstract: We show that grading standards for primary school ex
 ams in England have triggered\nan inflation of quality indicators in the na
 tional performance tables for almost two\ndecades. The cumulative effects h
 ave resulted in significant differences in the quality\nsignaled to parents
  for otherwise identical schools. These differences are as good as\nrandom\
 , with score inflation resulting from the grading discretion of external gr
 aders.\nWe study whether\, because of this inflation\, parents mistakenly u
 pdated their beliefs on\nthe preferred residential location — a primary fac
 tor for securing access to schools. We\nfind large housing price gains from
  the school quality improvements artificially signaled\nby inflation\, as w
 ell as lower deprivation and more businesses catering to families in\nlocal
  neighborhoods. The effects are persistent and identifiable through to the 
 present\nday.

DESCRIPTION:Abstract:  \nThis paper investigates the comparative advantage 
 provided by the shale gas revolution to the US manufacturing sector. It est
 imates the response of several economic variables related to the manufactur
 ing sector using dynamic panel data models that allow each sector's respons
 e to vary with its energy intensity. The paper shows that the decline in na
 tural gas prices in the US relative to natural gas prices in Europe has led
  to an increase in industrial activity of nearly 2%. It also shows that exp
 orts increased by less than 1% and imports decreased by more than 1%. Moreo
 ver\, empirical evidence is provided that indicates structural breaks in th
 e relationships between natural gas prices and imports or exports. However\
 , overall\, the paper concludes that\, even though the shale gas revolution
  helped some industries to expand\, it has not had a strong effect on the m
 anufacturing sector as a whole.

DESCRIPTION:Title: "Parametric Bootstrap P-values: Why they are good and ho
 w to compute them" <br>\nAbstract: For standard discrete models\, bootstrap
  P-value perform extraordinarily well\, much better than asymptotics predic
 t. I trace this to three specific mathematical properties of the bootstrap 
 transformation. First\, it corrects boundary anomalies. Second\, it improve
 s pivotality of the P-value. Third\, it correctly calibrates the P-value\, 
 but apparently only when applied to likelihood based test statistics. <br>\
 n\nI then move on to how to compute bootstrap (and other more exotic P-valu
 es) using importance sampling. This involves sampling whole curves from the
  profile distribution of the P-value. The standard recommendation for choos
 ing the biasing distribution fails\, at least for the case of logistic regr
 ession. I will identify why it fails and develop a better criterion which w
 orks extremely well in all examples considered.<br>\n\n<a href="http://www.

DESCRIPTION:"Estimating Incentive and Selection Effects in the Medigap Insu
 rance Market: An Application with Dirichlet Process Mixture Model"\n\nABSTR
 ACT\n\nThis paper presents an empirical study of endogenous treatment effec
 ts in the presence of heterogeneous responses. We estimate the incentive an
 d selection effects of having prescription drug coverage on total drug expe
 nditures using a sample from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS)
 .\n\nA Dirichlet Process Mixture (DPM) model is used to model the heterogen
 eity in treatment effects. Rather than estimating a finite mixture model wi
 th a fixed number of components\, we specify a DP prior on the pa- rameters
 \, thus allowing the data and prior knowledge to determine the number of co
 mponents. Endogeneity is modeled by the covariance of the error terms of th
 e selection and the outcome equations in a two-equation selection model.\n\
 nWe find that there are strong incentive and advantageous selection effects
 \, with the average treatment effect and the average treatment effect for t
 he treated estimated at $1132 and $858\, respectively. Substantial heteroge
 neity is found to exist in the selection effects\, particularly for those h
 aving lower drug expenditures.\n\nhttp://www.uq.edu.au/economics/trivedi-pr

DESCRIPTION:Title: Bayesian Estimation of Beta-type Distribution Parameters
  Based on Grouped Data\n\nAbstract: This study considers the estimation met
 hod of generalized beta (GB) distribution parameters based on grouped data 
 from a Bayesian point of view. Because the GB distribution\, which was prop
 osed by McDon-ald and Xu (1995)\, includes several kinds of familiar distri
 butions as special or limiting cases\, it performs at least as well as thos
 e special or limiting distributions. Therefore\, it is reasonable to estima
 te the parameters of the GB distribution. This study uses a Tailored random
 ized block Metropolis–Hastings (TaRBMH) algorithm proposed by Chib and Rama
 murthy (2010) to estimate the GB distribution parameters\, and this method 
 is applied to one simulated and two real datasets. Moreover\, the Gini coef
 ficients from the estimated parameters for the GB distribution are examined

DESCRIPTION:Title: Specialization in Bank Lending: Evidence from Exporting 
 Firms\n\nAbstract: This paper develops an empirical approach for identifyin
 g the existence of bank advantages in funding export activities of related 
 firms. We find that bank loan portfolios are skewed towards firms exporting
  to a given destination. This skewness predicts the flow of new loans in sp
 ecifications that saturate all bank-time and firm-time variation: firms tha
 t expand exports to a country increase debt disproportionately\, and are mo
 re likely to establish a new relationship\, with banks that specialize in t
 hat country. We show that bank credit supply shocks have a larger effect on
  exports towards the markets of specialization.

  to understand their impact on binary outcomes such as employment status\, 
 recession\, and country default. Our approach is based on Bayes' theorem an
 d Pareto approximations at the tail\, allowing for a flexible relationship 
 between covariates and outcomes. We further extend the discussion to static
  and dynamic panel data models accounting for individual-specific tail thic
 kness. We establish consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed es
 timator. We evaluate its finite-sample properties in Monte Carlo simulation
 s. In the empirical application\, we use a panel of small banks to study wh

  where both the dimension of parameter and the number of restrictions are d
 ivergent and an unknown function is involved\, are studied using the genera

 blished. Meanwhile\, a new test statistic is proposed for over-identificati
 on issue\,which also is workable for the traditional moment restriction mod
 els. In addition\,the potential sparsity under our setting is investigated 
 via the combination of GMM methodology and penalty function approach. Numer
 ical examples are used to verify the established theory.&nbsp\;<span><br></

 autopsy models of Meilijson (1981). We provide Monte Carlo experiments and

 are good reasons for asserting that this cannot be the case for the ﬁlters

  </b><br>Self-assessed health (SAH) is often used in health econometric mod
 els as the key explanatory variable or as a control variable. However\, the
 re is evidence questioning its test-retest reliability\, with up to 30% of 
 individuals changing their response. Building on recent advances in the eco
 nometrics of misclassification\, we develop ways of obtaining consistent es
 timates despite misclassification in reported SAH using data from a large r
 epresentative household survey where SAH was elicited twice\, to gain new i
 nsights into the nature of SAH misclassification and its potential for bias
 ing health econometric estimates. The results from applying our approach to
  nonlinear models of long-term mortality and chronic morbidities reveal tha
 t there is substantial heterogeneity in misclassification patterns. We find
  that adjusting for misclassification is important for estimating the impac
 t of SAH. For other variables of interest\, we find significant but general
 ly small changes to their estimates when misclassification is ignored.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Extended MaxT Tests of One-Sided Hypotheses\n\nAbstract:
  In many statistical applications of one-sided tests of multiple hypotheses
  researchers are often concerned not only with global tests of the intersec
 tion of individual hypotheses\, but also with multiple tests of individual 
 hypotheses. For example\, in clinical trial studies researchers often need 
 to nd out the ecacy of a treatment\, as well as the significance of each ou
 tcome measurement (endpoint) of the treatment. This paper proposes MaxT typ
 e tests aiming at improving the global power of existing MaxT tests. Our ex
 tended MaxT tests are constructed by adding an extra component to the maxim
 and set of existing MaxT tests. The added component is a weighted sum of ot
 her components. Some power properties relating to choices of weight are stu
 died. Our simulation study shows that the proposed tests can considerably i
 mprove the global power of existing MaxT tests and can also outperform many
  other global tests under some alternatives and/or some non-normal distribu
 tions. Furthermore\, it is shown that such global power improvement may inv
 olve little loss of power on multiple testing. Two real data examples in cl
 inical trial studies reported in the literature are re-examined. The result
 s of our tests suggest stronger evidence on treatment effects over MaxT tes
 ts and likelihood ratio tests while changing little on the evidence concern
 ing endpoint testing.

 rough optimization. For example\, researchers may be interested in the effe
 ctiveness of the bestpolicy found in a randomized trial\, or the best-perfo
 rming investment strategy basedon historical data. Such settings give rise 
 to a winner’s curse\, where conventionalestimates are biased and convention
 al confidence intervals are unreliable. Thispaper develops optimal confiden
 ce intervals and median-unbiased estimators thatare valid conditional on th
 e target selected and so overcome this winner’s curse. Ifone requires valid
 ity only on average over targets that might have been selected\,we develop 
 hybrid procedures that combine conditional and projection confidenceinterva
 ls to offer further performance gains relative to existing alternatives

 span></span></span>This study investigates the informational content of the
  VVIX\, traditionally viewed as a proxy for the S&amp\;P 500 index's volati
 lity of volatility (VOV). We show that this interpretation is incomplete: t
 he VVIX also embeds a long-run variance (LRV) component. To establish this 
 result\, we first demonstrate that regressions of squared VVIX on VOV proxi
 es gain substantial explanatory power once LRV measures are incorporated. W
 e then develop a tractable theoretical framework linking VVIX to three risk
  drivers—the instantaneous variance\, LRV\, and VOV—and show that the VVIX 
 loads on both VOV and LRV. Our empirical analysis reveals that VVIX dynamic
 s are dominated by LRV in calm markets\, but by VOV during financial stress
 . We further show that these variance components explain option returns in 
 distinct markets: S&amp\;P 500 index option straddles load on the instantan
 eous variance and LRV\, while VIX option straddles load on the VOV. Taken t
 ogether\, our results redefine the role of the VVIX\, establishing it as a 
 measure of both VOV and LRV uncertainty\, with important implications for h
 ow it should be read and used by finance practitioners.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Improved Tests for Spatial Correlation\n \nPeter M. Robi
 nson and Francesca Rossi\n \nAbstract: We consider testing the null hypothe
 sis of no spatial autocorrelation against the alternative of first order sp
 atial autoregression. A Wald test statistic has good first-order asymptotic
  properties\, but these may not be relevant in small or moderate-sized samp
 les\, especially as (depending on properties of the spatial weight matrix) 
 the usual parametric rate of convergence may not be attained. We thus devel
 op tests with more accurate size properties\, by means of Edgeworth expansi
 ons and the bootstrap. The finite-sample performance of the tests is examin
 ed in Monte Carlo simulations.

 come Inequality from a Centrist View: The Case of Australia\n\nAbstract: Th
 is paper introduces a new Lorenz dominance criterion that allows ranking in
 come distributions according to centrist measures à la Seidl and Pfingsten 
 (1997). In doing so\, it defines α -Lorenz curves by adapting the generaliz
 ed Lorenz curves to this case. In addition\, it provides an empirical illus
 tration of these tools using Australian income data for the period 2001–200
 8. The results suggest that despite the reduction of relative inequality\, 
 inequality increased for most centrist value judgments.

 he conditional forecastsfrom a hard or soft constraint in a fast and effici
 ent manner. We show in asimulation study that our proposed method produces 
 identical conditionalforecasts as in the Waggoner and Zha (1999) algorithm 
 but in a computationallymore efficient manner. We illustrate our proposed m
 ethod in a large BVAR modeland impose three simultaneous soft constraints t

DESCRIPTION:<b>Not Drowning\, Waving</b>\n\n<b>Abstract: </b>\nIn this tech
 nological age we are drowning in data. Good data visualisation helps us to 
 swim\, digest the data\, and learn about our world. The statistics communit
 y creates visualisation systems within the context of data analysis\, so th
 e graphics are designed to support and enrich the statistical processes of 
 data exploration\, modeling\, and inference. As a result\, statistical data
  visualisation has some unique features which differentiates it from visual
 isations made in other fields. Statisticians are always concerned with vari
 ability in observations and error in measurements\, both of which cause unc
 ertainty about conclusions drawn from data. Dealing with this uncertainty i
 s at the heart of classical statistics\, and statisticians have developed a
  huge body of inferential methods that help to quantify uncertainty. Statis
 tical data graphics cover a spectrum of methods including elegant static da
 ta visualisations and highly interactive and dynamic graphics used for expl
 oratory data analysis.\n\nIn this talk\, we will explain how graphical meth
 ods were used to study the tech boom and bust of the late 1990s\, food qual
 ity control\,  atmospheric CO2 levels and temperature changes\, stimulus fu
 nd spending\, university ranking\, PISA education data\, labor market wages
 \, stock market trends\, and soybean breeding for agribusiness. (Ok\, only 
 a selection of these will be used.) We will explain how interactive statist
 ical graphics systems are constructed that enable data exploration\, how th
 is differs from computer graphics\, and how incorporating inferential techn
 iques enables us to determine if what we see is real. We will also describe
  new developments that allow (almost) everyone to become developers. Good d
 ata visualisation equips statisticians to balance skepticism with discovery
 \, and helps business analysts swim with their data.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Semiparametric Selection Models with Binary Outcomes\n\n
 Abstract\nThis paper addresses the estimation of a semiparametric sample\ns
 election index model where both the selection rule and the outcome\nvariabl
 e are binary. Since the marginal effects are often of primary\ninterest and
  are difficult to recover in a semiparametric setting\, we\ndevelop estimat
 ors for both the marginal effects and the underlying\nmodel parameters. The
  marginal effect estimator only uses observations\nwhich are members of a h
 igh probability set in which the selection\nproblem is not present. A key i
 nnovation is that this high probability\nset is data dependent. The model p
 arameter estimator is a\nquasi-likelihood estimator based on regular kernel
 s with bias\ncorrections. We establish their large sample properties and pr
 ovide\nsimulation evidence confirming that these estimators perform well in
 \nfinite samples.\n\n<a href="http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/fgv/">Prof

DESCRIPTION:Title: Robust Estimation and Inference for Importance Sampling 
 Estimators with Infinite Variance \n\nAbstract: Importance sampling is a po
 pular Monte Carlo method used in a variety of areas in econometrics. When t
 he variance of the importance sampling estimator is infinite\, the central 
 limit theorem does not apply and estimates tend to be erratic even when the
  simulation size is large. We consider asymptotic trimming in such a \nsett
 ing. Specifically\, we propose a bias-corrected tail-trimmed estimator such
  that it is consistent and has finite variance. We show that the proposed e
 stimator is asymptotically normal\, and has good finite-sample properties i
 n a Monte Carlo study.

 <br><b>Title</b>: <span>Efficiency bounds for moment condition models with 
 mixed </span><span>identification strength</span></p><p><b>Abstract</b>: <s
 pan>Moment condition models with mixed identification strength are models t
 hat are point identified </span><span>but with estimating moment functions 
 that are allowed to drift to 0 uniformly over the parameter </span><span>sp
 ace. Even though identification fails in the limit\, depending on how slow 
 the moment functions </span><span>vanish\, consistent estimation is possibl
 e. Existing estimators such as the generalized method </span><span>of momen
 t (GMM) estimator exhibit a pattern of nonstandard or even heterogeneous ra
 te of </span><span>convergence that materializes by some parameter directio
 ns being estimated at a slower rate than </span><span>others. This paper de
 rives asymptotic semiparametric efficiency bounds for regular estimators </
 span><span>of parameters of these models. We show that GMM estimators are r
 egular and that the so-called </span><span>two-step GMM estimator – using t
 he inverse of estimating function’s variance as weighting </span><span>matr
 ix – is semiparametrically efficient as it reaches the minimum variance att
 ainable by regular </span><span>estimators. This estimator is also asymptot
 ically minimax efficient with respect to a large family </span><span>of los

DESCRIPTION:<b>Title: </b> Estimation of Quantile Regressions in the Presen
 ce of Sample Selection \n\n<b>Abstract: </b>\nThis paper focuses on the est
 imation of quantile regressions in the presence of sample selection. Earlie
 r work has investigated the difficulties in estimating a quantile regressio
 n model in the case of binary selection rule. This paper shows how these di
 fficulties are overcome when the selection rule is censored rather than bin
 ary. This\, in the mean regression case\, corresponds to the Tobit type 3 m
 odel. We provide a two step estimator for this model in which a first step 
 is estimated by distribution regression and is used to produce a control fu
 nction. We then show how the control function can be used in a second step 
 to allow quantile regression methods to be employed while accounting for se
 lection bias.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Leveraging Brand Equity for Effective Visual Product Des
 ign\n\nAbstract: For many consumer goods\, the visual appearance is a major
  determinant of market success.\nWhile there is an emerging literature on h
 ow objective design characteristics drive consumer\npreferences\, this lite
 rature has not yet taken into account that product design happens in the\nc
 ontext of a brand’s equity. This research addresses the question of how to 
 leverage brand equity\nwhen designing the visual appearance of a product. S
 pecifically\, it investigates the role of two\nkey strategic visual design 
 decisions: brand typicality (similarity within the brand’s range) and\nsegm
 ent typicality (similarity to the competitive set). Based on fluency theory
 \, the paper argues\nthat high equity brands benefit more from brand typica
 lity but less from segment typicality than\nlow equity brands. Using data f
 rom the US car market tracking market shares of 456 car models\nof 39 major
  brands operating in seven market segments across 13 years\, the study prov
 ide\nempirical evidence for this conjecture and derive implications for str
 ategic product design visual\nand design theory.

 /about/king.html">Max King</a>: A New Procedure for Multiple Testing of Eco
 nometric Models.<br />\nAbstract: A significant role for hypothesis testing
  in econometrics involves diagnostic checking. When checking the adequacy o
 f a chosen\nmodel\, researchers almost always employ a range of diagnostic 
 tests\, each of which is designed to detect a particular form of model inad
 equacy. A major problem is how best to control the overall probability of r
 ejecting the model when it is true and multiple test statistics are used. T
 his paper\npresents a new multiple testing procedure\, which involves check
 ing whether the calculated values of the diagnostic statistics are consiste
 nt with the postulated model being true. This is done through a combination
  of bootstrapping to obtain a multivariate kernel density estimator of the\
 njoint density of the test statistics under the null hypothesis and the Mon
 te Carlo simulations to obtain a p-value using this kernel density. The pro
 posed testing procedure is applied to tests for serial correlation in an ob
 served time series\, for normality\, and for model misspecification. We fin
 d that our testing procedure has correct or nearly correct sizes and good p
 owers\, particular for more complicated testing problems. We believe it is 
 the first good method for calculating the overall p-value for a vector of t
 est statistics based on simulation.<br />\n<br />\n\n\n<a href="http://user
 s.monash.edu.au/~gmartin/">Gael Martin</a>: Efficient Probabilistic Forecas
 ts for Counts<br />\n\nAbstract: Efficient probabilistic forecasts of integ
 er-valued random variables are derived. The optimality is achieved by estim
 ating the forecast distribution nonparametrically over a given broad model 
 class and proving asymptotic (nonparametric) efficiency in that setting. Th
 e method is developed within the context of the integer autoregressive clas
 s (INAR) of models\, which is a suitable class for any count data that can 
 be interpreted as a queue\, stock\, birth and death process or branching pr
 ocess. The theoretical proofs of asymptotic efficiency are supplemented by 
 simulation results that demonstrate the overall superiority of the nonparam
 etric estimator relative to a misspecified parametric alternative\, in larg
 e but finite samples. The method is applied to counts of stock market icebe
 rg orders. A subsampling method is used to assess sampling variation in the
  full estimated forecast distribution and a proof of its validity is given.

 ><b>Title</b>: Cointegration with Occasionally Binding Constraints</p><p><b
 >Abstract</b>: In the literature on nonlinear cointegration\, a long-standi
 ng open problem relates to how a (nonlinear) vector autoregression\, which 
 provides a unified description of the short- and long-run dynamics of a col
 lection of time series\, can generate 'nonlinear cointegration' in the prof
 ound sense of those series sharing common nonlinear stochastic trends. We c
 onsider this problem in the setting of the censored and kinked structural V
 AR (CKSVAR)\, which provides a flexible yet tractable framework within whic
 h to model time series that are subject to threshold-type nonlinearities\, 
 such as those arising due to occasionally binding constraints\, of which th
 e zero lower bound (ZLB) on short-term nominal interest rates provides a le
 ading example. We provide a complete characterisation of how common linear 
 and nonlinear stochastic trends may be generated in this model\, via unit r
 oots and appropriate generalisations of the usual rank conditions\, providi
 ng the first extension to date of the Granger-Johansen representation theor
 em from a linear to a nonlinear setting\, and thereby giving the first succ
 essful treatment of the open problem. The limiting common trend processes i
 nclude regulated\, censored and kinked Brownian motions\, none of which hav
 e previously appeared in the literature on cointegrated VARs. Our results a
 nd running examples illustrate that the CKSVAR is capable of supporting a f
 ar richer variety of long-run behaviour than is a linear VAR\, in ways that
  may be particularly useful for the identification of structural parameters
 . En route to establishing our main results\, we also develop a set of suff
 icient conditions for the processes generated by a CKSVAR to be stationary\
 , ergodic\, and weakly dependent.<br></p><p>The paper is available at: <a h

 >Title: </b>Do market-wide circuit breakers calm the markets or panic them?
  Evidence from the COVID-19 pandemic<br><b></b><br><b>Abstract: </b>Market-
 wide circuit breakers (MWCBs)\, which halt trading for 15 minutes across al
 l U.S. stock markets\, have been triggered four times in March 2020 amid th
 e COVID-19 pandemic. This paper provides some of the first evidence on the 
 efficacy of MWCBs with tick-by-tick stock trading data. Using a difference-
 in-differences approach\, we find that although MWCBs boost stocks’ trading
  volume\, they significantly increase stocks’ realized volatility and bid-a
 sk spread. Moreover\, the market opening and reopening mechanisms&nbsp\; of
  different stock exchanges complicate the operation of MWCBs. Our results s
 uggest that MWCBs can have the unintended consequences of panicking the mar
 kets for a prolonged period of time\, especially by aggravating market vola
 tility and liquidity conditions.&nbsp\;<br><b><br></b>

DESCRIPTION:<b>Increasing Trends in the Excess Comovement of Commodity Pric
 es</b>\n\n<b>Abstract:</b>\nWe investigate whether and how excess comovemen
 t of commodity returns has changed over the period 1983-2011. Using the STD
 CC model\, we find that significant increasing long-run trends in excess co
 movement have appeared since around 2000. We confirm that these increasing 
 trends are not caused just by the recent financial crisis or the changes in
  sensitivities to common macroeconomic shocks. Moreover\, we find no signif
 icant increasing trends among off-index commodity returns and small effects
  of global demand on increasing trends in excess comovement. These findings
  provide additional evidence for the timing and scope of the recent increas
 ing commodity-return correlations.

 inar introduces and investigates the properties of a novel bootstrap method
 \, the kernel block bootstrap\, for time-series data. The method applies a 
 kernel-based transformation to the original data and then uses the standard
  m out of n bootstrap for independent and identically distributed observati
 ons. The bootstrap method\, although akin to\, offers an improvement over t
 he tapered block bootstrap\, admitting kernels with unbounded support. Give
 n a suitable choice of kernel\, a kernel block bootstrap estimator of the s
 pectrum at zero asymptotically close to the optimal Parzen (1957) estimator
  is possible. The higher order bias and variance of the kernel block bootst
 rap variance estimator are derived. Like the tapered block bootstrap\, the 
 kernel block bootstrap has a favourable higher order bias property. The met
 hod is illustrated by an application to mean regression and the first-order
  asymptotic validity of the bootstrap approximation demonstrated.  Simulati
 ons indicate that the kernel block bootstrap may be efficacious in practice

 <br><p><b>Title:</b> How Does Potential Unemployment Insurance Benefit Dura
 tion Affect Re-employment Timing and Wages?</p><b>Abstract: </b>How potenti
 al benefit duration (PBD) of unemployment insurance (UI) affects wages and 
 matching is crucial to evaluate PBD extensions as a policy tool and to unde
 rstand the causal relation between unemployment\, job search and wages. Rec
 ent studies provide evidence from quasi-experiments\, but disagree even on 
 the sign of (local average) wage effects. We re-visit the regression discon
 tinuity design of Schmieder et al. (2016)\, but use more detailed data and 
 a wage decomposition to re-analyze the effects of PBD in a framework that a
 llows for unrestricted heterogeneity of both duration and wage effects. Our
  (preliminary) results indicate treatment effect heterogeneity that casts d
 oubt on simple mechanisms and complicates learning from (local) average eff
 ects. Specifically\, we first show that duration effects are heterogeneous\
 , which confirms that treatment changes dynamic selection. Our results so f
 ar suggest that PBD almost exclusively prolongs unemployment spells ending 
 close to exhaustion points. We examine pre-determined wage components to (p
 artly) separate dynamic selection from dynamic treatment effects. Dynamic s
 election is potentially non-monotonic and may create spurious treatment eff
 ects in our sample. We find that PBD affects wages only through the firm fi
 xed effect\, which adds to evidence on the importance of firms. It suggests
  that wage losses are likely due to firm attributes (such as bargaining pow
 er) rather than individual attributes (such as productivity). Purging (part
 s of) dynamic selection from re-employment wages shows that the steep wage 
 decline is mainly driven by the firm fixed effect\, but also by time-varyin
 g unobservables. The marked exhaustion effects have at most a small impact 
 on the effect of PBD on wages. Wage effects appear to accumulate through em
 ployment at lower-paying firms at short unemployment durations. Our current
  results are work in progress\, but demonstrate that heterogeneity in both 
 duration and wage effects alters the interpretation of common analyses and 
 thereby potentially reconciles diverging findings. We develop tools to make
  progress on important questions in the presence of essential heterogeneity

DESCRIPTION:Title: The Trickle-Down Effect of Mining Boom in Australia - A 
 Fact or Myth?\n\nAbstract: The mining sector in Australia has been flourish
 ing in recent years. There is a general perception that the benefits of the
  mining boom flow to other non-mining production and services sectors. This
  paper examines the relationship between the mining sector and various non-
 mining sectors in an attempt to unfold the role of mining sector in Austral
 ia. In particular\, the unobserved components model has been used to estima
 te the effects of output gap in mining sector on that of each of several no
 n-mining sectors. In general\, the results of the estimates do not suggest 
 significant positive effect running from the mining sector to other sectors
 \, implying that the trickle-down effect of the mining boom is probably a m
 yth.

 Effects</p><p>(joint with Sokbae Lee and Silvia Sarpietro)</p><p><b>Abstrac
 t</b>: We propose a method for forecasting individual outcomes and estimati
 ng random effects in linear panel data models and value-added models when t
 he panel has a short time dimension. The method is robust\, trivial to impl
 ement and requires minimal assumptions. The idea is to take a weighted aver
 age of time series- and pooled forecasts/estimators\, with individual weigh
 ts that are based on time series information. We show the forecast optimali
 ty of individual weights\, both in terms of minimax-regret and of mean squa
 red forecast error. We then provide feasible weights that ensure good perfo
 rmance under weaker assumptions than those required by existing approaches.
  Unlike existing shrinkage methods\, our approach borrows the strength - bu
 t avoids the tyranny - of the majority\, by targeting individual (instead o
 f group) accuracy and letting the data decide how much strength each indivi
 dual should borrow. Unlike existing empirical Bayesian methods\, our freque
 ntist approach requires no distributional assumptions\, and\, in fact\, it 
 is particularly advantageous in the presence of features such as heavy tail
 s that would make a fully nonparametric procedure problematic.</p><p>The wo

DESCRIPTION:Title: "Volatility in Oil Prices and Manufacturing Activity: <b
 r>\nAn Investigation of Real Options"\n<br>\nAbstract: Previous research sh
 ows that volatility in oil prices has tended to depress output\, as\nmeasur
 ed by non-residential investment and GDP. This is interpreted as evidence i
 n support\nof the theory of real options in capital budgeting decisions\, w
 hich predicts that uncertainty\nabout\, for example\, commodity prices\, wi
 ll cause firms to delay production and investment.\nWe continue that invest
 igation by analyzing the e¤ect of oil price uncertainty on monthly\nmeasure
 s of U.S. firm production related to industries in mining\, manufacturing a
 nd utilities.\nWe use a more general specification\, an updated sample that
  includes the increased oil price\nvolatility since 2008\, and we control f
 or other nonlinear measures of oil prices. We find\nadditional empirical ev
 idence in support of the predictions of real options theory\, and our\nresu
 lts indicate that the extreme volatility in oil prices observed in 2008 and
  2009 contributed\nto the severity of the decline in manufacturing activity

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Professor Antony Unwin (Professor Emeritus\, Augsburg 
 University)\n\nTitle: Understanding Potential Outliers using the O3 Plot.\n
 \nAbstract: Outliers may be important\, in error\, or irrelevant\, but they
  are tricky to identify and deal with. Whether a case is identified as an o
 utlier depends on the other cases in the dataset\, on the variables availab
 le\, and on the criteria used.  A case can stand out as unusual on one or t
 wo variables\, while appearing middling on the others.  If a case is identi
 fied as an outlier\, it is useful to find out why.  This talk discusses the
  O3 plot (Overview Of Outliers) for supporting outlier analyses. O3 plots s
 how which cases are often identified as outliers\, which are identified in 
 single dimensions\, and which are only identified in higher dimensions.  Th
 ey highlight which variables and combinations of variables may be affected 
 by possible outliers.  Applications include a demographic dataset for the B
 undestag constituencies in Germany and a university ranking dataset.

DESCRIPTION:Course: The Bootstrap\n\nThe bootstrap is a statistical techniq
 ue used more and more widely in econometrics. Al-\nthough the principle of 
 the bootstrap does not depend on simulation\, in practice simulation\nis al
 most always necessary for its implementation. Bootstrapping always involves
  setting\nup a bootstrap data-generating process (DGP). The main types of b
 ootstrap DGP in\ncurrent use will be discussed in the course\, with example
 s of their use in econometrics.\nThe fundamentals of bootstrap inference ca
 n be found in Chapters 4 and 5 of Davidson and\nMacKinnon (2004). This mate
 rial will be reviewed at the start of the course. Subsequently\,\nwe will s
 pend some time on an article I wrote a few years ago for a Russian journal 
 - I will\nuse the original English version\, since my Russian is very limit
 ed! This article contains\nmost of my latest thoughts on the topic. We will
  also look at a survey article written in\n2004 by myself and James MacKinn
 on\, most of which is still up-to-date.\n\nThe following is an approximate 
 outline of the course material.\n1 Basic ideas of the bootstrap and simulat
 ion.\n2 The parametric bootstrap.\n3 Resampling and the nonparametric boots
 trap.\n4 Condence intervals and bootstrap condence intervals.\n5 Bootstrap 
 renements.\n6 Models estimated with instrumental variables\n7 Heteroskedast
 icity: the Pairs bootstrap and the Wild bootstrap.\n8 Bootstrapping time se
 ries\n\nItems 1-6 are covered in the Russian paper and the survey article. 
 Depending on the time\navailable\, other\, more specialised\, topics treate
 d in recent journal articles will be covered.\nThe bibliography gives refer
 ences to these articles as well as to the main materials used\nfor the cour
 se.

 with Several Treatments<br><p><u></u></p><p><b>Abstract</b>:&nbsp\;We study
  two-way-fixed-effects regressions with several treatment variables. Under 
 a parallel trends assumption\, we show that the coefficient on each treatme
 nt identifies the sum of two terms. The first term is a weighted sum of the
  effect of that treatment in each group and period\, with weights that may 
 be negative and sum to one. The second term is a sum of the effects of the 
 other treatments\, with weights summing to zero. Therefore\, those coeffici
 ents are not robust to heterogeneous effects and may be contaminated by oth
 er treatments’ effects. We propose an alternative difference-in-differences
  estimator\, robust to heterogeneous effects and immune to the contaminatio
 n problem. To estimate\, say\, the first treatment’s effect\, our estimator
  compares the outcome evolution of a group whose first treatment changes wh
 ile its other treatments remain unchanged\, to control groups whose treatme
 nts all remain unchanged\, and with the same baseline treatments as the swi
 tching group.</p><b>Speaker Bio</b>:<i>&nbsp\;</i>Clément de Chaisemartin i

DESCRIPTION:Title: A Sparse Change-point VAR model (joint with Arnaud Dufay
 s\, Zhuo Li and Jeroen Rombouts)\n\nAbstract: This paper proposes a sparse 
 change-point vector autoregressive model\, or sparse CP-VAR\, \nto model mu
 ltivariate time series subject to multiple unknown structural breaks. We re
 lax the\nassumption that all parameters need to change when detecting autom
 atically for structural\nbreaks in a VAR model. The approach is general suc
 h that breaks can happen in either the\nautoregressive parameters\, spillov
 er parameters and variance matrix parameters. We achieve\nthis by shrinking
  irrelevant break-parameters towards zero in our estimation procedure which
 \nis based on a sampling scheme tailored to change-point models. Our shrink
 age methodology\nalleviates the search of an optimal number of regimes and 
 does only rely on one estimation\noutput. For generality\, breaks in the va
 riance matrix are governed by a hierarchical Dirichlet\nprocess.

 /span></span></span></span></span><b><span></span></b> Growing economic int
 egration and trade liberalization have increased openness and interdependen
 cies\, reshaping both the structure of global trade and the channels throug
 h which shocks propagate. This paper examines how foreign economic and fina
 ncial shocks transmit through trade to small open Asian economies. We estim
 ate a global vector autoregressive (GVAR) model\, linking the US\, the Euro
  Area\, China\, and Japan (G4) to the NIE-4 (Hong Kong\, Singapore\, South 
 Korea\, and Taiwan) and the ASEAN-4 (Malaysia\, Indonesia\, Thailand\, and 
 the Philippines) over 1980Q1 to 2019Q4. Country specific blocks include dom
 estic macro-financial variables and their foreign counterparts constructed 
 with time-varying trade weights to capture evolving linkages. The framework
  traces business-cycle co-movements and quantifies spillovers from G4 shock
 s to Asia\, highlighting heterogeneity between the NIE-4 and ASEAN-4 and id
 entifying how changing trade patterns alter exposure to external disturbanc
 es. Our findings emphasise that increased trade relations with China have i
 ntensified the impact of its economic shocks in the region. At the same tim
 e\, although the influence of the US has relatively diminished over the yea
 rs\, it continues to<br>be a crucial driver of growth in Asian economies.

DESCRIPTION:Title: A POWERFUL ENTROPY TEST FOR “LINEARITY” AGAINST NONLINEA
 RITY IN TIME SERIES\n\nAbstract. In this paper we investigate a test for th
 e identification of nonlin-\near dependence in time series against more gen
 eral “nulls” than mere “inde-\npendence”. The approach is based on a combin
 ation of an entropy dependence\nmetric\, possessing many desirable properti
 es and used as a test statistic\, to-\ngether with a suitable extension of 
 surrogate data methods\, a class of Monte\nCarlo based tests introduced wit
 h the aim of building consistent distribution-\nfree tests for nonlinearity
 . The use of bootstrap methods is also investigated.\nIn this paper we show
  how the test can be employed in order to detect the lags\nat which a signi
 ficant nonlinear relationship is expected in the same fashion\nas the autoc
 orrelation function is used for linear processes. We discuss some\ntheoreti
 cal aspects related to the entropy measure and its estimators. The\npower a
 nd size of the test is assessed through simulation studies\; applications\n
 to well known real data are also presented.\n\n<a href="http://userwww.serv

DESCRIPTION:Title: Estimating the Economy-Wide Rebound Effect Using Empiric
 ally Identified Structural Vector Autoregressions\n\nAbstract: The size of 
 the economy-wide rebound effect is crucial for estimating the contribution 
 that energy efficiency improvements can make to reducing greenhouse gas emi
 ssions and for understanding the drivers of energy use. Existing estimates\
 , which vary widely\, are based on computable general equilibrium models or
  partial equilibrium econometric estimates. Using a structural vector autor
 egressive (SVAR) model\, we identify the dynamic causal impact of structura
 l shocks\, including an energy efficiency shock. The identification method 
 is based on independent component analysis. In this manner\, we are able to
  estimate the rebound effect with a minimum of a priori assumptions. We app
 ly the SVAR to U.S. monthly and quarterly data\, finding that after four ye
 ars rebound is around 100%\, which implies that in the long run no energy i
 s saved.

DESCRIPTION:Course: The Bootstrap\n\nThe bootstrap is a statistical techniq
 ue used more and more widely in econometrics. Al-\nthough the principle of 
 the bootstrap does not depend on simulation\, in practice simulation\nis al
 most always necessary for its implementation. Bootstrapping always involves
  setting\nup a bootstrap data-generating process (DGP). The main types of b
 ootstrap DGP in\ncurrent use will be discussed in the course\, with example
 s of their use in econometrics.\nThe fundamentals of bootstrap inference ca
 n be found in Chapters 4 and 5 of Davidson and\nMacKinnon (2004). This mate
 rial will be reviewed at the start of the course. Subsequently\,\nwe will s
 pend some time on an article I wrote a few years ago for a Russian journal 
 - I will\nuse the original English version\, since my Russian is very limit
 ed! This article contains\nmost of my latest thoughts on the topic. We will
  also look at a survey article written in\n2004 by myself and James MacKinn
 on\, most of which is still up-to-date.\n\nThe following is an approximate 
 outline of the course material.\n1 Basic ideas of the bootstrap and simulat
 ion.\n2 The parametric bootstrap.\n3 Resampling and the nonparametric boots
 trap.\n4 Condence intervals and bootstrap condence intervals.\n5 Bootstrap 
 renements.\n6 Models estimated with instrumental variables\n7 Heteroskedast
 icity: the Pairs bootstrap and the Wild bootstrap.\n8 Bootstrapping time se
 ries\n\nItems 1-6 are covered in the Russian paper and the survey article. 
 Depending on the time\navailable\, other\, more specialised\, topics treate
 d in recent journal articles will be covered.\nThe bibliography gives refer
 ences to these articles as well as to the main materials used\nfor the cour
 se.

DESCRIPTION:Course: Bayesian numerical methods\n\nThe aim is to cover the r
 ecent emergence of dedicated numerical methods for processing the ever-incr
 easing complexity in statistical models. Time-series models\, latent variab
 le models\, and untractable likelihood models are three specific categories
  of (potentially) problematic models that have led to the emergence of spec
 ialised responses: sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods and particle filter
 s\, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods\, and approximate Bayesian comp
 utation (ABC) methods. I plan to cover those methods at the methodological 
 level\, illustrating their implementation in the above categories\, rather 
 than embarking upon a complete theoretical justification.

DESCRIPTION:GEERT MESTERS (VU University\, Amsterdam)\n\nURL (with link to 
 CV): http://geertmesters.nl/\n\nTitle: "Dynamic Factor Models with Stochast
 ic Loadings"\n\nAbstract: We consider the dynamic factor model for the case
  where the rows of the loading matrix\, the dynamic factors and the idiosyn
 cratic processes are treated as latent stochastic processes. Three results 
 are discussed that enable the efficient estimation of the loadings\, factor
 s and the parameter vector. First\, we provide an iterative algorithm to ev
 aluate the conditional modes of the loadings and the factors. Second\, we s
 how that the marginal likelihood can be accurately evaluated analytically u
 sing a convenient importance sampling representation. Third\, we show that 
 the conditional mean and variance for the loadings and the factors can be c
 alculated using basic simulation methods. In particular\, we calculate the 
 integral over the factors analytically and evaluate the remaining loading-d
 ependent terms via importance sampling. The methods are systematically inve
 stigated in a Monte Carlo study where we document the finite sample propert
 ies and compare the methods with existing procedures. The new methods are f
 urther illustrated in two empirical applications (i) for the term structure
  of interest rates and (ii) for business cycle modeling.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Modelling Electricity Power Cuts in the UK\n\nAbstract: 
 We consider a compound Poisson model for electricity power cuts. Cuts occur
  at rate $\\lambda$ and we associate with the $i$-th cut a duration $L_i$ a
 nd size $C_i$\, where $L_i$ and $C_i$ are heavy tailed and positively corre
 lated. Development of the model is complicated by the fact that we have no 
 direct observations of $(L_i\, C_i)$. Rather\, if $N$ is the number of powe
 r cuts in a year\, we have observations of $\\sum_{i=1}^N C_iL_i$ and $\\su
 m_{i=1}^N C_i$. This necessitates the use of a parsimonious model for $(L_i
 \, C_i)$\, and we have based ours on the Pareto distribution. To fit the mo
 del we apply kernel density estimation to simulated data to obtain estimate
 s of the likelihood\, which we then maximise using stochastic optimisation.

DESCRIPTION:Tittle: NONPARAMETRIC INSTRUMENTAL DERIVATIVES\n\nAbstract. The
  focus of this paper is the nonparametric estimation of the marginal effect
 s (i.e. first partial derivatives) of an instrumental regression function φ
  defined by conditional moment restrictions that stem from a structural eco
 nometric model E[Y−φ(Z)|W ] = 0\, and involve endogenous variables Y and Z 
 and instruments W . The derivative function φ′ is the solution of an ill-po
 sed inverse problem and we propose an estimation procedure based on\nLandwe
 ber-Fridman regularization. The paper presents theoretical properties of th
 e estimated nonparametric instrumental marginal effects\, examines finite-s
 ample performance\, and considers an illustrative application.\n\nFor more

DESCRIPTION:Title: Mitigating model uncertainty using trace optimisation: A
 n application to exponential smoothing\n\nAbstract: \nExponential smoothing
  is a reference method within the forecasting discipline\, due to its simpl
 icity\, relatively good forecasting accuracy and ease of automation. The li
 terature has continuously improved upon many of its initial limitations. Ho
 wever\, novel applications have brought new forecasting challenges where ex
 ponential smoothing methods have provided contradictory findings\, revealin
 g pitfalls in its use. In this work we examine potential reasons for these 
 inconsistencies and argue that special attention should be drawn to the cos
 t function used to fit the model. Conventional cost functions assume that t
 he postulated model is true\, which is hardly case for many applications. W
 e propose the use of alternative cost functions based on multi-step ahead p
 redictions and trace forecasts and demonstrate substantial benefits in term
 s of accuracy\, a connection with shrinkage estimators\, and direct implica
 tions for practice for solar irradiation forecasting and other forecasting 
 applications.

 le correction of Windmeijer (2005) which corrects for the bias from estimat
 ing the efficient weight matrix\, so is doubly corrected. An important feat
 ure of the proposed double correction is that it automatically provides rob
 ustness to misspecification of the moment condition. In contrast\, the conv
 entional variance estimator and the Windmeijer correction are inconsistent 
 under misspecification. That is\, the proposed double correction formula pr
 ovides a convenient way to obtain improved inference under correct specific
 ation and robustness against misspecification at the same time.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Weekly Hedonic House Price Indices: An Imputation Approa
 ch from a Spatio-Temporal Model\n\nabstract\nWe develop a method for comput
 ing house price indices at a weekly frequency using the hedonic imputation 
 method. The price indices are computed using the Törnqvist superlative form
 ula applied to matched samples derived from the hedonic model. Typically\, 
 with the hedonic imputation method\, the model is estimated period-by-perio
 d and location is controlled for using postcode dummies. This may not be fe
 asible at a weekly frequency. Instead\, we develop a spatio-temporal model 
 represented in a state-space formulation that controls for location with a 
 geospatial spline surface. The model is parsimonious and shadow price param
 eters are connected over time while retaining the property of non-revisabil
 ity of the index as new time periods are added to the data set. We show the
  spatio-temporal specification leads to a modified form of the Kalman filte
 r and a Goldberger's adjusted form of the predictor to obtain the imputatio
 ns. Using data for Sydney (Australia) we show that weekly house price indic
 es are much more sensitive than quarterly indices to the choice of hedonic 
 method.  We then show using a novel criterion that our approach to computin
 g house price indices at a weekly frequency outperforms competing alternati
 ves.\n\nSeminar organiser: Wei Wei

DESCRIPTION:Wind power forecasts with lead times up to a few hours are impo
 rtant for system operators and utilities to maintain a balanced and reliabl
 e power system. Commonly\, these forecasts are computed by time series mode
 ls that are mainly based on past data from the forecast site. More advanced
  models additionally employ data from surrounding sites or can adapt to cha
 nges in the weather regime or wind farm setup. The wealth of data generated
  by an increasing number of wind power installations does not only provide 
 possibilities for improvements but also challenges for common forecasting m
 ethodologies. We will introduce\, apply and discuss some of the recent prop
 osals for high-dimensional modelling and forecasting\, mainly based on vect
 or autoregression (VAR) and some generalization (for instance with regime-s
 witching)\, as well as sparsification of coefficient matrices. This will fi
 rst include the well-known Lasso VAR\, as well as an online version of that
  estimator. Furthermore\, alternative approaches to sparsification for VAR 
 models will be presented and the balance between forecast accuracy and comp
 utational costs will be considered. Applications will be based on datasets 
 with tens to hundreds of sites in Europe and Australia and perspectives for
  operational applications with thousands of sites will be discussed.

 on or with pre-sale information. Using data from the Australian Art Sales D
 igest for the one hundred top selling Australian Indigenous artists over th

  price heterogeneity in a differentiated market such as that for Australian
  Indigenous art.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Why Waste Your Vote? Informal Voting in Compulsory Elect
 ions in Australia \n\nAbstract: Voter turnout in mature democracies tends t
 o range from around 50-70%. Low\, for something as critical as electing pol
 icymakers\, but much higher than basic economic theory would predict. Even 
 in Australia\, where voting is compulsory\, there are still around 5-6% of 
 voters who submit an informal vote\, which does not count towards the total
 . We make use of a natural experiment\, based on exogenous changes in elect
 orate boundaries\, to identify what factors influence the number of wasted 
 votes. In advance from the existing literature\, we test a range of potenti
 al contributing factors together\, in a single model\, and with causal inte
 rpretation. We find that factors that feature in the traditional theory on 
 voter decisions\, competitiveness and number of other voters\, do not affec
 t the rate of informal voting. Instead\, we find that more candidates on th
 e ballot results in higher levels of informal voting. This effect is presen
 t regardless of the level of education\, which indicates that it is likely 
 to be associated with a decision by the voter to abstain rather than an err
 or. We conclude that making the way voters can express their preferences as
  simple as possible would be beneficial for reducing wasted votes.

 ing Exchange Rates? Evidence Using a Large Panel of Individual Stock Prices
 </p><p>(joint with Yumeng Cui and Naijing Huang)</p><p><b>Abstract</b>: It 
 has been established since Meese and Rogoff (1983) that it is difficult to 
 beat a random walk in forecasting exchange rates by using time series and e
 conomic models of exchange rates. This paper employs a novel econometric mi
 cro approach to forecasting exchange rates based on a large panel of indivi
 dual stock prices\, which is expected to contain valuable information about
  future exchange rates according to economic theory. Our results demonstrat
 e that this novel micro forecasting method significantly enhances the accur
 acy of exchange rate forecasting when compared to macro-econometric models 
 such as Random Walk\, AR and Factor family models. By employing machine lea
 rning algorithms\, we can effectively aggregate the information contained i
 n individual stock prices\, which leads to more precise exchange rates fore
 casts. Moreover\, the improvement achieved through the micro forecasting me
 thod becomes increasingly prominent as the forecast horizon increases.</p><

 irth rates has been widely documented between and within countries\,however
  a small literature suggests that caesarean birth is not independent ofthe 
 interventions which precede it. In this study\, we employ population-basedd
 ata from 2004 to 2018 on a sample of over 390\,000 births to examine the us
 e ofa sequence\, or ‘cascade’\, of birth&nbsp\;interventions. It is theincr
 ease over time in this cascade outcome that underlies the observation thatw
 omen have become much more likely to receive all of the interventions in ou
 rstudy\, and commensurately much less likely to give birth without interven
 tion.Our focus is on inter-hospital variations\, and methodological conside
 rations ofhow to model hospital-level effects in light of potential selecti
 on biases andin the absence of any plausibly exogenous variation in hospita
 l assignment. Wefind a large range of hospital-level effects relating to th
 e use of a cascadeof interventions and contextualise our findings in the di
 scourse on hospitalpractice styles\, which in relation to maternity care po
 sits that a lessinterventionist style committed to natural birth is possibl
 e and in contrast toa more medicalised and interventionist style.</p><p><b>

  for Linear IV Models with Misspecification and Weak Identification<br><br>
 <b>Abstract</b>: In this paper\, we study the inference problem under missp
 eci…cation in a linear instrumental variable (IV) regression with potential
  weak identification. Under weak IV\, inference is typically done via hypot
 hesis testing. Thus we first introduce the concept of pseudo-true parameter
  value  for a test and investigate the pseduo-true value for the 2SLS-t tes
 t\, the Anderson-Rubin (AR) test\, the Lagrange Multiplier (LM)\, and the c
 onditional likelihood ratio (CLR) test. We find that only the 2SLS-t test h
 as a unique proper pseudo-true value that has an economic interpretation in
  a commonly considered scenario. We then focus attention on the 2SLS-t test
  pseudo-true value and design a group of tests that are robust to both weak
  IV and misspecification.<br><br>Kind regards<br>Dan\, Ben\, Michael and Kl

DESCRIPTION:Title: Prediction with several macromodels\n\nAbstract: There a
 re several relevant layers of uncertainty that characterise econometric mod
 els routinely used for policy making. First and foremost\, there is intrins
 ic uncertainty about the future conditional on a model and parameters. Then
  there is extrinsic uncertainty about model parameters conditional on a mod
 el. Then there is uncertainty about models conditional on a set of models. 
 In addition there is unconditional uncertainty\, when all models considered
  are false. \n\nIn this paper we incorporate all four levels of uncertainty
  and we assess the improvements in the quality of prediction that we get by
  doing so. We provide a practical example based on the joint combination of
  a DSGE model\, a Bayesian VAR and a dynamic factor model for a set of US m
 acroeconomic time series. In our paper we find that : \n1.Taking into consi
 deration parameter uncertainty is most relevant in periods of unusual data.
  \n2. A pool with equal weights provides predictions of superior quality wi
 th respect to prediction obtained with individual models \n3. We introduce 
 a measure of value of each of the models being combined that can be decompo
 sed across sub-periods and this measure provides important indication regar
 ding the usefulness of the individual models. \n\nProfessor Amisano is a Pr
 ofessor of Econometrics at the University of Brescia and a senior economist
  at the European Central Bank. For more information\, please visit <a href=

DESCRIPTION:Title: Statistical inference in the multifractional cointegrate
 d VAR model\nAbstract: The multifractional cointegrated vector autoregressi
 ve (MFCVAR) model is defined as an extension of the FCVAR model to allow ea
 ch observed variable to have its own fractional parameter. Cointegration\, 
 representation\, and statistical inference is discussed in the MFCVAR model
 \, and the relevant asymptotic theory is derived. The notion of cointegrati
 on connectedness of a group of variables is defined\, and it is found that 
 the maximum likelihood estimators of contrasts between the fractional order
 s of connected variables are superconsistent\, leading to asymptotically mi
 xed Gaussian inference. The remaining estimators and test statistics retain
  their asymptotic properties from the more standard FCVAR model.

DESCRIPTION:<b> Measuring the Compositional Bias in Earnings Growth Over a 
 Cyclical Upwsing </b>\n\n<b> Abstract </b>\n\nWe use Linked Employer-Employ
 ee Database (LEED) data from New Zealand to investigate the impact of chang
 es in the composition of workers and firms on measured average real full-ti
 me equivalent (FTE) earnings growth over the cyclical upswing between 1999 
 and 2007. During this period\, employment increased by over 20 percent and 
 measured average FTE earnings increased by 9 percent (1.3 percent annually)
 . In contrast\, we estimate that composition-adjusted average FTE earnings 
 grew 15 percent. The changing composition of workers accounts for 5 percent
 age points of the difference: 60 percent from the entry of lower-paid worke
 rs\, and 25 and 15 percent respectively from lower-paid continuing and inte
 rmittently-employed workers working more. The remaining 1 percentage point 
 difference is associated with the changing composition of firms: this was l

  small degree by an increase in employment by existing firms.

DESCRIPTION:Measuring the Connectedness of the Global Economy\n\nABSTRACT\n
 \nThe introduction of the panel and global VAR frameworks and the increasin
 g sophistication  of large simulated systems provides opportunities to anal
 yse international linkages in unprecedented depth. However\, the considerab
 le volume of statistical output generated by such models introduces a secon
 dary curse of dimensionality\, whereby the limits of the modeller's ability
  to process the output become a binding constraint. This paper develops a f
 amily of Generalized Connectedness Measures (GCMs) which provide a simple m
 eans to summarise the linkages embodied in such models non-selectively eith
 er with recourse to geographic aggregation or aggregation into desired grou
 ps of similar variables. These GCMs are derived from generalized forecast e
 rror variance decompositions in a manner that extends the connectedness mea
 sures developed by Diebold and Yilmaz (2009\, 2013). Our GCMs preserve info
 rmation across horizons and are robust both to the reordering of variables 
 and to aggregation. We apply our approach using the 26 country 176 variable
  GVAR model developed by Greenwood-Nimmo\, Nguyen and Shin (2012\, Journal 
 of Applied Econometrics) and derive vivid representations of the linkages e
 mbodied in the model. Our results indicate that the US\, the Eurozone and t
 he crude oil market are hot-spots for the transmission of shocks in the glo
 bal economy and that shocks transmitted through equity markets can strongly
  affect real magnitudes.\n\nhttp://www.greenwoodeconomics.com/

 of oil is determined by the interactions of multiple producers and consumer
 s who face different constraints and shocks. We show how this feature of th
 e oil market can be used to estimate local and global elasticities of suppl
 y and demand and provide a rich set of testable restrictions. We develop a 
 novel approach to estimation based on full-information maximum likelihood t
 hat generalizes the insights from granular instrumental variables. We concl
 ude that the supply responses of Saudi Arabia and adjustments of inventorie
 s have historically played a key role in stabilizingthe price of oil. We il
 lustrate how our structural model can be used to analyze how individual pro
 ducers and consumers would dynamically adapt to a geopolitical event such a
 s a major disruption in the supply of oil from Russia.

DESCRIPTION:We explore how judgment can be used to improve model selection 
 for forecasting. We investigate the performance of various judgmental model
  selection methodologies against the benchmark statistical one\, based on i
 nformation criteria. Apart from the simple model choice approach\, we exami
 ne the efficacy of a model build approach\, where experts are asked to iden
 tify the structural components (trend and seasonality) of the time series. 
 Based on a large sample of almost 700 participants that contributed in a cu
 stom-designed laboratory experiment\, we evaluate the performance of indivi
 duals and groups of experts in terms of selecting the best model and foreca
 sting performance\, identifying major improvements. Finally\, we examine ho
 w to extend statistical model selection to incorporate additional insights 
 from experts.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Option Pricing with Market Frictions and Regime Switchin
 g\n\nAbstract: Market frictional costs prevail in financial markets and pla
 y a significant role in asset pricing as well as other important areas in e
 conomics and finance. In this talk\, I shall discuss a modelling framework\
 , which aims to integrate the impacts of three fundamental features includi
 ng market frictional costs\, regime switches and ambiguity on option prices
 . The ask and bid prices of a European option in such incomplete market are
  characterized as solutions of coupled nonlinear partial differential equat
 ions. An approach based on the minimization of a relative entropy is used t
 o determine a fair value between the ask and bid prices. A simple closed-fo
 rm solution to the minimization problem is obtained\, which indicates that 
 the fair value does not price the regime-switching risk in the presence of 
 market frictions. Numerical experiments on the model are conducted. The num
 erical results indicate the significance of incorporating market frictional
  costs in option valuation under the regime-switching environment.

 issues arising in commonly used models of economic and financial time serie
 s. Two highly popular configurations are shown to be asymptotically observa
 tionally equivalent: one with long memory and weak autoregressive dynamics\
 , the other with antipersistent shocks and a near-unit autoregressive root.
  We develop a data-driven semiparametric and identification-robust approach
  to inference that reveals such ambiguities and documents the prevalence of
  weak identification in many realized volatility and trading volume series.
  The identification-robust empirical evidence generally favors long memory 
 dynamics in volatility and volume\, a conclusion that is corroborated using
  social-media news flow data.</p><p><b>Speaker Bio</b>:<i>&nbsp\;</i>Shupin

  derivatives are financial instruments designed to mitigate losses caused <

 nd for wind derivatives to manage </span><span>uncertainty in wind power pr
 oduction is expected to increase. However\, existing </span><span>wind deri
 vative literature often assumes normally distributed wind speed\, despite <
 /span><span>the presence of skewness and leptokurtosis in historical wind s
 peed data. This </span><span>paper investigates how the mis-specification o
 f wind speed models affects wind </span><span>derivative prices and propose
 s the use of the generalized hyperbolic distribution </span><span>to allow 
 for non-normality. The study develops risk-neutral approaches for pricing <
 /span><span>wind derivatives using the conditional Esscher transform\, whic
 h can accommodate </span><span>stochastic processes with any distribution. 
 The analysis demonstrates that model </span><span>risk differs depending on
  the choice of the underlying index and the derivative’s </span><span>payof
 f structure. Therefore\, caution should be exercised when choosing wind spe
 ed </span><span>models\, and model risk cannot be ignored in pricing wind s
 peed derivatives.</span></p><p><b>Speaker Bio</b>:<i> </i><span>Rui Zhou ho

DESCRIPTION:<b>Title: </b> Bayesian model averaging and principal component
  regression forecasts in a data rich environment\n \n<b>Abstract:</b> This 
 paper studies the `real-time' out-of-sample forecast performance of Bayesia
 n moving averaging (BMA) and principal component regression (PCR) applied t
 o many predictors. The paper conducts a different out-of-sample investigati
 on in which the forecasts are constructed jointly for U.S. inflation and ou
 tput allowing the forecast errors to be correlated. The posterior distribut
 ion of models and parameters are re-estimated\, and the 12-months-ahead for
 ecasts are computed for each month using a 10-years rolling window. This ti
 me-varying reduced form offers flexibility in capturing structural changes 
 and instabilities of unknown forms. While the competing forecasts are highl
 y correlated\, PCR performed marginally better than BMA in terms of mean-sq
 uared forecast error. Both PCR and BMA fail to improve over the random walk
  model during the great moderation. However\, analysis of the local relativ
 e performance indicates that PCR may outperform BMA with statistically sign
 ificant margins. Further\, PCR forecasts match the first and second moments
  of the target series with minimal biases\, while BMA forecasts fail to mat
 ch the volatility of the series\, especially inflation. Orthogonalizing the
  predictors may bring computational gains but at a great loss of performanc
 e.

 r><br><b>Title</b>: Functional Quantile Autoregression</p><p><b>Abstract</b
 >: <span>Conditional distribution or conditional quantiles provides importa
 nt information in time series analysis. In this paper\, we propose a new cl
 ass of time series models\, the functional quantile autoregression (FQAR) m
 odels\, in which the conditional distribution of the observation at the cur
 rent time point is affected by its past distributional information\, and ex
 pressed as a functional of the past conditional quantile functions. The mod
 els can capture systematic influences of the past distributional informatio
 n on the current conditional distribution\, and therefore constitute a sign
 ificant extension of traditional time series models in which the effect of 
 conditioning information is confined to only a few selected characteristics
  of the past distribution.</span></p>The FQAR models are similar to functio
 nal autoregression models. However\, different from conventional functional
  time series models which are based on functionally observed data\, the pro
 posed model and method study functional dynamics in traditional time series
  data. In fact\, the FQAR models share some similar features to the GARCH m
 odel. However\, instead of only focusing on the dynamic relationship of the
  second moments (conditional variance)\, we look at the relationship betwee
 n the current conditional distribution to the past conditional distribution
  in a functional autoregressive form. Stationary conditions of the model ar
 e provided. We propose a sieve estimator for the model. Under stationarity 
 conditions\, the FQAR model converges and facilitates an estimation that do
 es not depend on the initial quantile function. Identification is investiga
 ted. The asymptotic properties of the estimators are derived. A Monte Carlo
  experiment is conducted to investigate the finite sample performance of th
 e proposed estimator and an empirical application to stock return time seri
 es highlights the proposed method.<br><p><b>Speaker Bio</b><span>:</span><i

DESCRIPTION:Title: \nAn evaluation of simple forecasting model selection ru
 les\n\nAbstract:\nA major problem for many organisational forecasters is to
  choose the appropriate forecasting method for a large number of data serie
 s. Model selection aims to identify the best method of forecasting for an i
 ndividual series within the data set. Various selection rules have been pro
 posed in order to enhance forecasting accuracy. In theory\, model selection
  is appealing\, as no single extrapolation method is better than all others
  for all series in an organizational data set. However\, empirical results 
 have demonstrated limited effectiveness of these often complex rules. The c
 urrent study explores the circumstances under which model selection is bene
 ficial. Three measures are examined for characterising the data series\, na
 mely predictability (in terms of the relative performance of the random wal
 k but also a method\, theta\, that performs well)\, trend and seasonality i
 n the series. In addition\, the attributes of the data set and the methods 
 also affect selection performance\, including the size of the pools of meth
 ods under consideration\, the stability of methods’ performance and the cor
 relation between methods. In order to assess the efficacy of model selectio
 n in the cases considered\, simple selection rules are proposed\, based on 
 within-sample best fit or best forecasting performance for different foreca
 st horizons. Individual (per series) selection is contrasted against the si
 mpler approach (aggregate selection)\, where one method is applied to all d
 ata series. Moreover\, simple combination of methods also provides an opera
 tional benchmark. The analysis shows that individual selection works best w
 hen specific sub-populations of data are considered (trended or seasonal se
 ries)\, but also when methods’ relative performance is stable over time or 
 no method is dominant across the data series.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Is female labour supply in Australia not responsive to c
 hild care costs? <br>\n<br>\nAuthors: Xiaodong Gong and Robert Breunig<br>\
 n\nAffiliation: Australian National University<br>\n\n\nAbstract<br>\n\nPre
 vious studies (Doiron and Kalb (2005)\, Kalb and Lee (2008)\, Rammohan and 
 Whelan(2005) and Rammohan and Whelan (2007)) have found that female labour 
 supply in Australia is not responsive to the costs of child care.  The labo
 ur supply elasticity with respect to child care costs has been found to be 
 very small and usually statistically insignificant.<br>\n\n\nWe show that t
 hese papers\, and many papers in the international literature\, suffer from
  a measurement error problem arising from the way in which child care price
 s are measured.  Furthermore\, and exacerbating the measurement error probl
 em\, the standard model assumes that child care for different age children 
 is a homogenously-priced good.<br>\n\n\nWe address these problems by extend
 ing the standard\, structural labour supply and child care model to allow f
 or separate effects of the price of child care for children of different ag
 e ranges.  We estimate women's labour supply and child care demand simultan
 eously.  To overcome measurement error issues\, we use the median child car
 e price at the local Labour Force Survey Region level constructed from chil
 d-specific prices for the analysis. The salient finding\, in contrast with 
 previous Australian studies\, is that child care prices have significant ef
 fects both on mothers’ labour supply and child care demand. Based upon the 
 latest three waves of HILDA data (2005-2007)\, the point estimate for the e
 lasticity of mothers’ labour force participation with respect to the averag
 e child care price is -0.29\, which is significantly larger in magnitude th
 an that found in previous studies for Australia\, but which is well in acco
 rdance with international findings. The robustness of this finding is suppo
 rted by repeating the analysis for the earlier three waves (2002-2004).<br>

 on for drift-diffusion Processes<br><br>Abstract: Logarithms of prices of f
 inancial assets are conventionally assumed to follow drift-diffusion proces
 ses. While the drift term is typically ignored in the infill asymptotic the
 ory and applications\, the presence of nonzero drifts is an undeniable fact
 . The finite sample theory and extensive simulations provided in this paper
  reveal that the drift component has a nonnegligible impact on the estimati
 on accuracy of volatility and leads to a dramatic power loss of a class of 
 jump identification procedures. We propose an alternative construction of v
 olatility estimators and jump tests and observe significant improvement of 
 both in the presence of nonnegligible drift. As an illustration\, we apply 
 the new volatility estimators and jump tests\, along with their original ve
 rsions\, to 21 years of 5-minute log-returns of the NASDAQ stock price inde
 x.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Uncertainty and the macroeconomy: A real-time out-of-sam
 ple evaluation\n\nAbstract: Many economic uncertainty measures have been pr
 oposed during the last decade. They are all imperfect proxies of a latent e
 ntity and are supposed to be related to output variables. This paper identi
 fies and classifies 15 monthly uncertainty measures based on how they measu
 re economic uncertainty. We show that there is an underlying factor structu
 re and identify two interpretable factors. First\, a general economic uncer
 tainty factor with a slight tilt toward financial conditions. Second\, a co
 nsumer/media confidence index which remains elevated after recessions. Furt
 hermore\, we conduct a real-time out-of-sample forecasting analysis on the 
 mean and quantiles of the four coincident variables (industrial production\
 , employment\, personal income\, and manufacturing and trade sales) to asse
 ss whether the relationship with output variables holds out-of-sample. The 
 uncertainty factors hold little predictive power for the mean\, but are inf
 ormative when forecasting the lower quantiles -- the left tail -- of indust
 rial production and in particular employment. This suggests a nonlinear rel
 ationship between economic uncertainty and output.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Efficient estimation of parameters in marginals in semip
 arametric multivariate models <br>\n<br>\n\nAbstract:<br>\nRecent literatur
 e on semiparametric copula models focused  on the situation when the margin
 als are specified nonparametrically and the copula function is given a para
 metric form. For example\, this setup is used in Chen\, Fan and Tsyrennikov
  (2006) [Efficient Estimation of Semiparametric Multivariate Copula Models\
 , JASA] who focus on efficient estimation of copula parameters.  We conside
 r a reverse situation when the marginals are specified parametrically and t
 he copula function is modelled nonparametrically. This setting is no less r
 elevant in applications.<br>\n\nWe use the method of sieve for efficient es
 timation of parameters in marginals and show its asymptotic distribution.  
 Simulations show improvements in the efficiency of sieve MLE relative to QM
 LE depending on the strength of dependence between marginals.  An applicati
 on using insurance company loss and expense data demonstrates empirical rel
 evance of this setting.\n<br>\n\n<a href="http://www.economics.unsw.edu.au/

 ation of the forecasts. In an artificial experiment\, the implications of v
 arying the level of asymmetry in the ACPS are illustrated. Then\, the propo
 sed score and test are applied to assess and compare density forecasts of m
 acroeconomic relevant datasets (US employment growth) and of commodity pric

DESCRIPTION:Instrument-Free Identification and Estimation of Differentiated
  Products Models Using Cost Data\n\nABSTRACT\n\nIn this paper\, we propose 
 a methodology for jointly estimating the demand and cost functions of diffe
 rentiated goods oligopoly models when demand and cost data are available. T
 he method deals with the endogeneity of prices to unobserved product qualit
 y in the demand function\, as well as the endogeneity of output to unobserv
 ed cost shocks in firms' cost functions. Our method does not\, however\, re
 quire instruments to do so. We establish identification\, consistency and a
 symptotic normality of our estimator. Using Monte-Carlo experiments\, we de
 monstrate that it works well in situations where instruments are correlated
  with the error term in the demand and cost functions\, and where the stand
 ard IV approach results in bias.\n\nhttps://www.uts.edu.au/staff/susumu.ima

DESCRIPTION:Title: Identification Robust Inference for Risk Prices in Struc
 tural Stochastic Volatility Models\n\nAbstract: In structural stochastic vo
 latility asset pricing models\, changes in volatility affect risk premia th
 rough two channels: (1) the investor’s willingness to bear high volatility 
 in order to get high \nexpected returns as measured by the market return ri
 sk price\, and (2) the investor’s direct aversion to changes in future vola
 tility as measured by the volatility risk price. Disentangling these\nchann
 els is difficult and poses a subtle identification problem that invalidates
  standard inference.\nWe adopt the discrete-time exponentially affine model
  of Han\, Khrapov\, and Renault (2018)\,\nwhich links the identification of
  the volatility risk price to the leverage effect. In particular\, we\ndeve
 lop a minimum distance criterion that links the market return risk price\, 
 the volatility risk\nprice\, and the leverage effect to well-behaved reduce
 d-form parameters that govern the return\nand volatility’s joint distributi
 on. The link functions are almost flat if the leverage effect is\nclose to 
 zero\, making estimating the volatility risk price difficult. We translate 
 the conditional\nquasi-likelihood ratio test that Andrews and Mikusheva (20
 16) develop in a nonlinear GMM\nframework to a minimum distance framework. 
 The resulting conditional quasi-likelihood ratio\ntest is uniformly valid. 
 We invert this test to derive robust confidence sets that provide correct\n
 coverage for the risk prices regardless of the leverage effect’s magnitude.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Fiscal Multipliers: Playing with Multiple Instruments\n\
 nWe estimate fiscal spending and tax multipliers for the US economy by empl
 oying different combinations of fiscal and non-fiscal instruments in a prox
 y-SVAR framework. We do so by working with a novel identification strategy 
 which allows us to jointly estimate the multipliers and assess the overall 
 validity of the SVAR specification. We provide robust evidence in favor of 
 a fiscal spending multiplier larger than one. Turning to the tax multiplier
 \, we show that the strikingly different results one finds in the literatur
 e on small vs. large tax multipliers can be replicated by allowing one non-
 fiscal instrument (total factor productivity) to proxy different sets of sh
 ocks (output shocks only vs. output and tax shocks jointly). In particular\
 , we show that assuming total factor productivity to be orthogonal to tax s
 hocks implies a tax multiplier around one. However\, if this orthogonality 
 assumption is relaxed\, the tax multiplier is estimated to be three times l
 arger and in line with what the proxy-SVAR literature finds when using fisc
 al proxies for the tax shocks.

 nTitle:\nSovereign Ratings and Oil-Producing Countries: Have Sovereign Rati
 ngs Run Ahead of Fundamentals?\n\nAbstract:\nWe investigate whether rising 
 oil prices have resulted in over-rating of oil-producing countries by ratin
 g agencies\, after controlling for fundamentals. Based on a large dataset o
 f countries from Standard and Poor’s and Moody’s\, we find strong statistic
 al evidence of a large ratings premium–nearly two notches–for those oil pro
 ducing countries with a large share of net oil revenue to gross domestic pr
 oduct\, relative to countries with similar economic fundamentals. We have s
 ome limited forecast information from the rating agencies and the effect in
 creases when we include this information\, providing further evidence that 
 this ratings premium is not driven by expected improvements in fundamentals
 . This finding has significant implications for asset prices in oil-produci
 ng countries and highlights the risk that in the event of a sharp unanticip
 ated drop in oil prices\, sovereign rating downgrades of oil-producing coun
 tries could be sharper than the\ndeterioration in their economic fundamenta
 ls.

DESCRIPTION:Title\n\nPoint Optimal Testing with Roots That are Functionally
  Local to Unity\n\nAbstract\n\nLimit theory for regressions involving local
  to unit roots (LURs) is now used extensively in time series econometric wo
 rk\, establishing power properties for unit root and cointegration tests\, 
 assisting the construction of uniform condence intervals for autoregressive
  coecients\, and enabling the development of methods robust to departures f
 rom unit roots. The present paper shows how to generalize LUR asymptotics t
 o cases where the localized departure from unity is a time varying function
  rather than a constant. Such a functional local unit root (FLUR) model has
  much greater generality and encompasses many cases of additional interest 
 that appear in practical work\, including structural break formulations tha
 t admit sub-periods of unit root\, local stationary and local explosive beh
 avior within a given sample. Point optimal FLUR tests are constructed in th
 e paper to accommodate such cases and demonstrate how the power envelope ch
 anges in case of practical interest. Against FLUR alternatives\, convention
 al constant point optimal tests can have extremely low power\, particularly
  when the departure from unity occurs early in the sample period for which 
 a new analytic explanation is provided. Simulation results are reported and
  some implications for empirical practice are examined.

 ew estimators of realized variance\n\nAbstract: This paper explores the pre
 dictive power of new estimators of the conditional variance of the stock ma
 rket returns and the equity variance risk premium for economic activity and
  financial instability. These estimators are obtained from new parametric a
 nd semiparametric asymmetric extensions of the heterogeneous autoregressive
  model. We find\, using the new specifications\, that the equity variance r
 isk premium is a predictor of future stock returns while realized variance 
 is often rejected as a predictor for short and moderate prediction horizons
 . Furthermore\, both variables are also predictors of financial instability
  and\, for some horizons\, of economic activity.\nAll in all\, new semipara
 metric models with asymmetric measures of realized variance improve conside
 rably the predictive power of the variance risk premium when considering st
 ock market returns and financial instability.\n\nSeminar organiser: Hsein K

DESCRIPTION:Bivariate asymmetric GARCH models with heavy tails and dynamic 
 conditional correlations\n\nABSTRACT\n\nA bivariate generalized autoregress
 ive conditional heteroskedastic model with dynamic conditional correlation 
 and leverage effect (DCC-GJR-GARCH) for modelling financial time series dat
 a is considered. For robustness it is helpful to assume a multivariate Stud
 ent-t distribution for the innovation terms. This paper proposes a new modi
 fied multivariate t-distribution which is a robustifying distribution and o
 ffers independent marginal Student-t distributions with different degrees o
 f freedom\, thereby highlighting the relationship among different assets. A
  Bayesian approach with adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo methods is used f
 or statistical inference. A simulation experiment illustrates good performa
 nce in estimation over reasonable sample sizes. In the empirical studies\, 
 the pair-wise relationship between the Australian stock market and foreign 
 exchange market\, and between the US stock market and crude oil market are 
 investigated\, including out-of-sample volatility forecasts. \n\nhttp://syd

DESCRIPTION:Title: Mixed Graphical Models with Applications to Integrative 
 Cancer Genomics\n\nAbstract: "Mixed Data'' comprising a large number of het
 erogeneous variables (e.g. count\, binary\, continuous\, skewed continuous\
 , among others) is prevalent in varied areas such as imaging genetics\, nat
 ional security\, social networking\, Internet advertising\, and our particu
 lar motivation - high-throughput integrative genomics. There have been limi
 ted efforts at statistically modeling such mixed data jointly. In this talk
 \, we address this by introducing several new classes of Markov Random Fiel
 ds (MRFs)\, or graphical models\, that yield joint densities which directly
  parameterize dependencies over mixed variables. To begin\, we present a no
 vel class of MRFs arising when all node-conditional distributions follow un
 ivariate exponential family distributions that\, for instance\, yield novel
  Poisson graphical models. Next\, we present several new classes of Mixed M
 RF distributions built by assuming each node-conditional distribution follo
 ws a potentially different exponential family distribution. Fitting these m
 odels and using them to select the mixed graph in high-dimensional settings
  can be achieved via penalized conditional likelihood estimation that comes
  with strong statistical guarantees. Simulations as well as an application 
 to integrative cancer genomics demonstrate the versatility of our methods.

DESCRIPTION:Course: Bayesian numerical methods\n\nThe aim is to cover the r

 easing complexity in statistical models. Time-series models\, latent variab
 le models\, and untractable likelihood models are three specific categories
  of (potentially) problematic models that have led to the emergence of spec

 itle:\nU-statistics\, Trimming and a New Robust Measure of Spread\n \n\nAbs
 tract:\nThe family of U-statistics contains many well-known measures of loc
 ation and spread such as the sample mean and sample variance of a sequence 
 of independent random variables. These traditional statistics often do not 
 exhibit good robustness properties so trimming either the underlying sample
  or the kernel values can provide more robust alternatives.\n\nConditions t
 hat ensure the trimmed U-statistic is asymptotically normally distributed w
 ere established by Janssen et al. (1987)\, however the general limiting beh
 aviour can\n\nbe more complex. This was noted by Stigler (1973) for the cas
 e of the trimmed mean. We will explore these ideas for trimmed U-statistics
 .\n\nFurther\, other widely used robust estimators of location and spread\,
  such as the Hodges-Lehmann estimator and Qn introduced by Rousseeuw and Cr
 oux (1993)\, can be expressed as quantiles of U-statistic kernel values. Th
 is connection allows application of the asymptotics for U-processes to esta
 blish the asymptotic behaviour of these statistics. These observations will
  be applied to obtain the asymptotics of a new U-quantile based robust meas
 ure of spread. This talk is based on joint works with Yuri Borovskikh\, Sam
 uel Muller and Garth Tarr.

 these change over time with the evolution of technologies and markets. Our

 a statistical foundation to formally test the significance of these connect

 ctively control the familywise error rate in finite samples. We also extend
  our methodology to include cluster-based analysis\, thereby broadening the
  applicability of our approach. Simulation results confirm that our procedu
 res not only ensure the simultaneous finite-sample correctness of the set o

DESCRIPTION:Title: Evaluating Consumers’ Choices of Medicare Part D Plans: 
 A Study in Behavioral Welfare Economics\n\n\n\nAbstract: We propose new met
 hods to model behavior and conduct welfare analysis in complex \nenvironmen
 ts where some choices are unlikely to reveal preferences. We develop a mixt
 ure-of-\nexperts model that incorporates heterogeneity in consumers’ prefer
 ences and in their choice\nprocesses. We also develop a method to decompose
  logit errors into latent preferences versus\noptimization errors. Applying
  these methods to Medicare beneficiaries’ prescription drug\ninsurance choi
 ces suggests that: (1) average welfare losses from suboptimal choices are s
 mall\,\n(2) beneficiaries with dementia and depression have larger losses\,
  and (3) policies that simplify\nchoice sets offer small average benefits\,
  helping some people but harming others.

DESCRIPTION:Course: Bayesian numerical methods\n\nThe aim is to cover the r
 ecent emergence of dedicated numerical methods for processing the ever-incr
 easing complexity in statistical models. Time-series models\, latent variab
 le models\, and untractable likelihood models are three specific categories
  of (potentially) problematic models that have led to the emergence of spec
 ialised responses: sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods and particle filter
 s\, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods\, and approximate Bayesian comp
 utation (ABC) methods. I plan to cover those methods at the methodological 
 level\, illustrating their implementation in the above categories\, rather 
 than embarking upon a complete theoretical justification.

DESCRIPTION:Bootstrap Methods for Inference with Cluster-Sample IV Models.\
 n\nAbstract:  Microeconomic data often have within-cluster dependence. This
   dependence affects standard error estimation and inference in the instrum
 ental variables model. When the number of clusters is small\, Wald and weak
 -instrument tests can be severely oversized. We examine the use of bootstra
 p methods and find that variants of the wild bootstrap perform well and red
 uce absolute size bias significantly\, independent of instrument strength o
 r cluster size. We also provide guidance in the choice among weak-instrumen
 t tests when data have cluster dependence. Two empirical examples illustrat
 e the application of our wild bootstrap methods.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Likelihood-Based Confidence Sets for the Timing of Struc
 tural Breaks\n\nWe propose a new approach to constructing confidence sets f
 or the timing of structural breaks. The confidence sets are based on margin
 al “fiducial” distributions of break dates\, which are simulated from the l
 ikelihood function via Markov-chain Monte Carlo methods. We show that the c
 onfidence sets can be related to a sequence of average exponential likeliho
 od ratio tests and are\, therefore\, admissible. Using Monte Carlo analysis
 \, we compare the finite-sample performance of our proposed approach to sta
 ndard asymptotic and bootstrap confidence sets for break dates given struct
 ural breaks of the kind hypothesized for macroeconomic data. The confidence
  sets based on marginal fiducial distributions perform best overall in term
 s of short length and accurate coverage. For our application\, we investiga
 te the nature and timing of structural breaks in postwar U.S. Real GDP. Bas
 ed on our proposed approach\, we find much tighter 95% confidence sets for 
 the timing of the so-called “Great Moderation” than have been previously re
 ported.\n\n\n<a href="http://www.asb.unsw.edu.au/schools/Pages/JamesMorley.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Institutions\, Geography and Trade: A Panel Data Study\n
 \nAbstract: This paper employs a panel data approach to examine the impact 
 of institutions\, trade and geography on economic development. Our approach
  enables us to account for unobserved heterogeneity across countries\, an i
 ssue that cannot be addressed in the cross-section framework. Moreover\, em
 ploying the Hausman and Taylor approach allows us to obtain direct paramete
 r estimates of the time invariant explanatory variables like geography or s
 ome institutional measures.\nOur findings indicate that institutions\, econ
 omic integration\, and geography are all valid determinants of economic dev
 elopment with regard to statistical significance and robustness but differ 
 substantially in terms of their economic impact.\n\n\nDr Thomas Osang is an

DESCRIPTION:Title: Quasi-Difference in Differences with Panel Data: Complet
 e Pairing and Least Squares Estimator\n\nAbstract:\nWith one treated and on
 e untreated periods\, difference in differences (DD) requires a ‘zero selec
 tion-effect condition’ that the untreated response changes be the same acro
 ss the treatment and control groups\, if the treatment were withheld contra
 ry to the fact. A natural way to check the condition is to backtrack one pe
 riod and examine the response changes in two pre-treatment periods. If the 
 condition does not hold in the pre-treatment periods\, then under the assum
 ption that the pre-treatment gap will persist\, the modified DD takes the f
 orm of ‘quasi-difference in differences (QD)’\, which is ‘triple difference
 s’ with one additional time-wise difference. QD generalizes DD with a weake
 r identification condition: a timeconstant\, but not necessarily zero\, sel
 ection effect\; QD is also less vulnerable to a clustered data problem ofte
 n plaguing DD. This paper addresses how to test whether the pre-treatment g
 ap is persistent or not with panel data\, and how to modify DD with QD acco
 rdingly. Nonparametric estimators/tests and panel linear-model-based LSE/te
 sts are proposed\, and a simulation study is presented.\n\nFor more informa

DESCRIPTION:On Confidence Sets for Variable Selection\n\nABSTRACT\n\nIn thi
 s talk\, I discuss the notion of variable selection confidence set (VSCS)  
 for linear regression based on F-testing. The VSCS extends the usual notion
  of confidence\nintervals to the variable selection problem: A VSCS is a se
 t of regression models that contains the true model with a given level of c
 onfidence. For noisy data\, distinguishing among competing models is usuall
 y very difficult and the VSCS will contain many models\; if the data are re
 ally informative\, the VSCS will contain a much smaller number of useful mo
 dels. I advocate special attention to the set of lower boundary models (LBM
 s)\, which are the most parsimonious models that are not statistically sign
 ificantly inferior to the full model at a given confidence level. Based on 
 the LBMs\, variable importance and measures of co-appearance importance of 
 predictors can be naturally defined.  Our method identifies the most import
 ant variables in a principled way that goes beyond simply trusting the sing
 le lucky winner based on a model selection criterion.\n\nUp to date\, an al
 most exclusive emphasis has been on selecting a single model or two. In the
  presence of a number of predictors\, especially when the number of predict
 ors is comparable to (or even larger than) the sample size\, the hope of id
 entifying the true or the unique best  model is often unrealistic. Conseque
 ntly\, a better approach is to select a relatively small set of models that
  all can more or less adequately explain the data at the given confidence l
 evel. This strategy identifies the most important variables in a principled
  way that goes beyond simply trusting the single lucky winner based on a mo
 del selection criterion.\n\nhttp://www.findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/display/

 ltivariate data analysis – A community-level basis function approach</p><p>
 <b>Abstract:&nbsp\;</b>This talk focuses on the statistical modeling of spa
 tio-temporal multivariate abundance data. That is\, data which are spatiall
 y and/or temporally indexed\, and consists of multiple (usually) discrete r
 esponses characterized by a strong mean-variance relationship. Such data ca
 n arise in a number of disciplines\, with a prime example being in ecology 
 where long running surveys collect data on species communities to understan
 d their spatio-temporal evolution and how they are/will respond to a changi
 ng climate. The most commonly used approach for analyzing spatio-temporal m
 ultivariate abundance data is using some flavor of spatio-temporal latent v
 ariable models (LVMs)\, although known as spatio-temporal factor analytic m
 odels. However\, while methodological and computational advances continue t
 o be made with LVMs\, their application to spatio-temporal multivariate abu
 ndance data remains computationally burdensome and not necessarily scalable
  when it comes to model fitting and inference.</p><p>&nbsp\;In this talk\, 
 we propose an alternative approach to spatio-temporal multivariate modeling
  which breaks away from the LVM framework. Inspired by the concept of fixed
  rank kriging\, we employ a set of common fixed spatial and/or temporal bas
 is functions\, with corresponding response-specific random slopes to accoun
 t for spatio-temporal correlations both within and</p><p>between responses.
  The resulting community-level basis function model (CBFM) can be used for 
 the same array of purposes as spatio-temporal LVMs\, but is designed to be 
 computationally much more efficient given they can be set up and fitted usi
 ng the same machinery as for generalized additive models. Simulations and a
 n application to a demersals fish dataset collected off the Northeast US co
 ntinental shelf illustrate the potential of CBFMs for scalable spatio-tempo
 ral multivariate modelling.</p><p><b>&nbsp\;</b>More information about the

 ure of trends in time series with finite sample\, we establish a coordinate
  system to detect common trending features in non-stationary time series an
 d estimate the co-trending relationship between them. We find that the tren
 d in global temperatures and greenhouse gases is common indicating a stable
  long-run relationship between them. We also find extra cycles in global te
 mperatures that improves in-sample and out-of-sample forecasts of our regre
 ssion model. Finally\, we explore the direction of causation in the co-tren
 ding relationship as a theoretical foundation for the control of global war

DESCRIPTION:Title: How Costly to Sell A Company? A Structural Analysis of T
 akeover Auctions\n\nAbstract: To explain why sellers in takeover auctions l
 imit bidders' entry\, we structurally measure two negative effects of invit
 ing an additional bidder on the seller's revenue: information cost and oper
 ation cost. In particular\, our auction model allows for bidders to discoun
 t their synergy values when their rivals obtain the confidential informatio
 n {we refer to the induced revenue loss as the information cost. We establi
 sh the identication \nof the model primitives with unobserved heterogeneity
 \, naturally arising from the\ncondential information. From a sample with 2
 87 M&A deals of U.S. public companies\,\nwe nd that the unobserved heteroge
 neity explains 75.3% of the variation of the value\nand bidders lower their
  values by 7.6% for each rival. We quantify the information\ncost and opera
 tion cost using counterfactual analysis\, and discuss policy implications\n
 for the seller as well as regulatory and judiciary authorities.

DESCRIPTION:Title: \nMoving Average Stochastic Volatility Models with Appli
 cation to Inflation Forecast\n\nAbstract:  \nMoving average and stochastic 
 volatility are two important components for modeling and forecasting macroe
 conomic and financial time series. The former aims to capture short-run dyn
 amics\, whereas the latter allows for volatility clustering and time-varyin
 g volatility. We introduce a new class of models that includes both of thes
 e useful features. The new models allow the conditional mean process to hav
 e a state space form. As such\, this general framework includes a wide vari
 ety of popular specifications\, including the unobserved components and tim
 e-varying parameter models. Having a moving average process\, however\, mea
 ns that the errors in the measurement equation are no longer serially indep
 endent\, and estimation becomes more difficult. We develop a posterior simu
 lator that builds upon recent advances in precision-based algorithms for es
 timating this new class of models. In an empirical application involving U.
 S. inflation we find that these moving average stochastic volatility models
  provide better in-sample fitness and out-of-sample forecast performance th
 an the standard variants with only stochastic volatility.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Exploiting strong instruments unduly neglected by standa
 rd GMM\n\nAbstract: While coping with non-sphericity of the disturbances\, 
 GMM suffers from a blind spot for exploiting the strongest possible instrum
 ents. In this study it is demonstrated that its established optimality is a
 chieved over a too inflexible interpretation of the adopted moment restrict
 ions. In particular\, GMM does not automatically respect the golden rule th
 at exogenous regressors establish their own strongest possible instruments.
  For some typical cross-section and dynamic panel data models it is shown b
 y simulation that under moderate heteroskedasticity straight-forward modifi
 cations of the exploited set of instruments\, which respect just the very s
 ame population moment conditions\, can achieve very substantial reductions 
 in both bias and variance in finite samples. That feasible adapted implemen
 tations of GMM as proposed here have profound positive effects on the signi
 ficance of inference in models with non-spherical disturbances is illustrat
 ed also by estimating a micro employment equation for a panel of UK compani
 es.\n\nFor more information\, please refer to <a href="https://sites.google

DESCRIPTION:What's the Point of Class? Random Coefficients versus Latent Cl
 ass Models\n\nRecent applied work using panel data have postulated that het
 erogeneity in intercept and slope parameters arises due to the fact that th
 e sample is drawn from a finite mixture of populations\, each having their 
 own responses\, see e.g. Deb (2001)\, Trivedi and Deb (2002)\,Winkelmann (2
 004)\, Bago d'Uva (2005\, 2006)\, Clark et al. (2005)\, Halliday (2008) and
  Harris and Sosa-Rubí (2009). The resulting estimator uses a finite number 
 of mass points to non-parametrically determine the latent classes\, which i
 s then identical to the non-parametric maximum likelihood estimator (NPMLE)
 . The found classes are often interpreted as high users and low users\, or 
 the sick and the healthy and separate marginal effects of e.g. income are e
 stimated for the groups. However\, using longitudinal data\, groups are onl
 y identified by the non-parametric maximum likelihood estimator (NPMLE) if 
 there is no further unobserved heterogeneity within the groups. As is well 
 known\, the NPMLE can approximate general unobserved heterogeneity distribu
 tions well. The question then arises as to whether we truly do have latent 
 classes in the population\, or whether are we simply approximating a (conti
 nuous) heterogeneity distribution? We will attempt to distinguish these two
  using recent developments in Bayesian estimation\, using MCMC.

DESCRIPTION:Title: The Variance Profile\n\nAbstract: The variance profile i
 s defined as the power mean of the spectral density function of a\nstationa
 ry stochastic process. It is a continuous and non-decreasing function of th
 e power\nparameter\, p\, which returns the minimum of the spectrum (p → −∞)
 \, the interpolation error\nvariance (harmonic mean\, p = −1)\, the predict
 ion error variance (geometric mean\, p = 0)\,\nthe unconditional variance (
 arithmetic mean\, p = 1) and the maximum of the spectrum (p →\n∞). The vari
 ance profile provides a useful characterisation of a stochastic process\; w
 e focus in\nparticular on the class of fractionally integrated processes. M
 oreover\, it enables a direct and\nimmediate derivation of the Szeg¨o-Kolmo
 gorov formula and the interpolation error variance\nformula. The paper prop
 oses a non-parametric estimator of the variance profile based on the\npower
  mean of the smoothed sample spectrum\, and proves its consistency and its 
 asymptotic\nnormality. From the empirical standpoint\, we propose and illus
 trate the use of the variance\nprofile for estimating the long memory param
 eter in climatological and financial time series and\nfor assessing structu
 ral change.\n\n<a href="http://ideas.repec.org/e/ppr15.html">Professor Proi

 d Efficiency-Improving Copulas: In Search of the Holy Grail of Dependence M
 odeling<br><br>Abstract: <br><br>The talk is about how to use copulas in ef
 ficient and robust estimation of the parameters in marginals. If we just us
 e the information in the marginals assuming independence we have a consiste
 nt by inefficient estimator (QMLE) and the question is how to achieve asymp
 totic efficiency without sacrificing robustness\, that is\, without losing 
 consistency. A parametric way to do this is to assume a copula and conduct 
 a full MLE (FMLE). Turns out that this will not improve efficiency if the c
 opula family is such that the copula score function is a linear combination
  of the marginal score functions\, a very rare condition\, which also guara
 ntees robustness. The trouble is that if this condition does not hold we ge
 nerally lose robustness unless the copula is correctly specified. An altern
 ative is to model the copula nonparametrically\, possibly with a sparsity p
 enalty induced by some machine learning method. The result is a semiparamet
 ric sieve MLE (SMLE) that reaches the semiparametric bound\, if consistent.
  However\, machine learning of copulas generally results in model selection
  errors. This requires the construction of Neyman orthogonal projections of
  the marginal scores that are insensitive to mistakes in the copula. Turns 
 out that these projections are easily obtained using moment and parameter r
 edundancy results in the GMM framework. The talk is based on a few papers c
 oauthored with subsets of the following coauthors: David Drukker\, Di Liu\,
  Ivan Medovikov\, Valentyn Panchenko and Peter Schmidt. <br><br>Bio: <br><s

DESCRIPTION:<b>Title: </b> Robust Inference with Clustered Data\n\nProf. Ca
 meron's talk is based on the paper  "A Practitioner's Guide to Cluster-Robu
 st Inference" (joint with Douglas L. Miller) forthcoming in <i> Journal of 
 Human Resources</i>\,Spring 2015. \n\n<b> Abstract: </b>\nWe consider stati
 stical inference for regression when data are grouped into clusters\, with 
 regression model errors independent across clusters but correlated within c
 lusters. Examples include data on individuals with clustering on village or
  region or other category such as industry\, and state-year differences-in-
 differences studies with clustering on state. In such settings default stan
 dard errors can greatly overstate estimator precision. Instead\, if the num
 ber of clusters is large\, statistical inference after OLS should be based 
 on cluster-robust standard errors. We outline the basic method as well as m
 any complications that can arise in practice.  These include cluster-specif
 ic fixed effects\, few clusters\, multi-way clustering\, and estimators oth
 er than OLS.\n\nThe paper is available to download from the following url:

 ral Bank\nSunil Sharma\, International Monetary Fund\n\nThe paper investiga
 tes the growth effects of international financial integration\, and their d
 ependence on two key factors - country governance quality and the level of 
 domestic financial market development. To capture such conditionality\, a c
 lass of dynamic panel data models with conditionally pooled coefficients is
  proposed. The econometric framework takes account of short- and long-run d
 ynamics\, cross-country heterogeneity\, cross-sectional dependence\, and th
 e potential endogeneity of international financial integration. Novel indic
 es of governance quality and domestic financial market development\, that c
 an capture these two factors for a panel involving 78 industrial\, emerging
  market and developing countries for the time period from 1970 to 2009\, ar
 e used. The estimation results suggest that the growth effects of internati
 onal fi…nancial integration vary critically with the level of governance qu
 ality and domestic financial market development.

 </p><p><b>Abstr</b><b>act</b>: <span>Public health measures introduced as a
  response to the COVID-19 pandemic have </span><span>affected cancer pathwa
 ys by halting screening\, delaying diagnostic tests and reducing the </span
 ><span>numbers of patients starting treatment. We propose a methodology tha
 t can be applied </span><span>to critical illness and life insurance underw
 riting to quantify the impact of such delays on </span><span>breast cancer 
 mortality. We introduce a semi-Markov model based on publicly available </s
 pan><span>population data for women in England and on relevant medical lite
 rature. Our modelling </span><span>approach also extends an insurance indus
 try-based multiple state model\, by incorporating </span><span>events relat
 ed to cancer diagnosis\, progression and undiagnosed cases. We quantify age
 -</span><span>specific excess deaths\, for a period up to 5 years\, along w
 ith years of life expectancy </span><span>lost and changes in cancer mortal
 ity by cancer stage. Our analysis suggests a 3–6% </span><span>increase in 
 breast cancer deaths\, and a 4–6% increase in registrations of advanced bre
 ast </span><span>cancer for women aged 65–89. Our approach exhibits consist
 ent results in sensitivity </span><span>analyses\, providing a model that c
 an account for changes in breast cancer diagnostic and </span><span>treatme
 nt services. We then obtain actuarial fair premiums for a specialised criti
 cal illness </span><span>and life insurance product for women aged 30–60. O
 ur analysis shows that the semi-</span><span>Markov model leads to results 
 aligned with the empirical evidence. Our findings point </span><span>out th
 e importance of accounting for the time spent with a diagnosed or undiagnos
 ed </span><span>pre-metastatic breast cancer in actuarial applications.</sp

DESCRIPTION:Title: The Meta-Taylor Rule\n\nAbstract: This paper provides a 
 characterisation of U.S. monetary policy within a generalized Tay- lor rule
  framework that accommodates uncertainties about the duration of policy reg
 imes and the specification of the rule\, in addition to the standard parame
 ter and stochastic un- certainties inherent in traditional Taylor rule anal
 ysis. Our approach involves estimation and inference based on Taylor rules 
 obtained through standard linear regression methods\, but combined using Ba
 yesian model averaging techniques. Employing data that were available in re
 al time\, the estimated version of the ‘meta’ Taylor rule provides a flexib
 le but compelling characterisation of monetary policy in the United States 
 over the last forty years.\n\nThe paper is available from <a href="http://w

DESCRIPTION:Abstract:  <br>\nWe study the ability of conditional and uncond
 itional backtests to detect misspecification of Value-at-Risk (VaR) models.
  We include the most common conditional and unconditional tests\, a quantil
 e regression-based test\, and some conditional Lagrange multiplier test bas
 ed on a Probit model that are designed to detect exception cluster- ing. We
  demonstrate how backtesting can be used as a economically-motivate model s
 pecification tool for multivariate volatility models\, and derive condition
 s under which the asymptotic distribution of the test statistics are unaffe
 cted by the use of consis- tent estimates in place of the true parameter va
 lues. We undertake a Monte Carlo experiment to study the finite sample beha
 vior of a range of conditional backtesting procedures and find that the unc
 onditional coverage test\, which is the only test cur- rently used by banki
 ng regulators\, cannot reject historical simulation-based VaR when it is mi
 sspecified. We find that the conditional tests and the quantile regression-
 based test in particular\, do have power when there is a relatively long da
 taset. In an empirical study of actual bank VaR models we find that all fiv
 e bank’s VaR models are misspec- ified and that much of the deficiency is d
 ue to their inability to adjust to changes in volatility. <br>\n\n<a href="

DESCRIPTION:Title: "Model Diagnostics via Khmaladze's Martingale Transform"
 \n\nAbstract: \n\nA classical problem in statistics is to fit a distributio
 n up to unknown location-scale parameters. This problem is generic to many 
 other statistical models including the celebrated regression and autoregres
 sive and generalize autoregressive conditionally heteroscedastic (ARCH-GARC
 H) models where one is testing that innovations are from a given distributi
 on. It will be argued that the Khamaladze's martingale transformation of th
 e residual empirical process that yields asymptotically distribution free t
 ests for the one sample location-scale model does the same thing for a para
 metric heteroscedastic regression model\, nonparametric regression models a
 nd for ARCH-GARCH models.\n\n<a href="http://www.stt.msu.edu/~koul/">Profes

DESCRIPTION:Title: Markov Interacting Importance Samplers\n\nAbstract: We i
 ntroduce a new Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler called the Markov In
 teracting Importance Sampler (MIIS). The MIIS sampler uses conditional impo
 rtance sampling (IS) approximations to jointly sample the current state of 
 the Markov Chain and estimate conditional expectations\, possibly by incorp
 orating a full range of variance reduction techniques.  We compute Rao-Blac
 kwellized estimates based on the conditional expectations to construct cont
 rol variates for estimating expectations under the target distribution. The
  control variates are particularly efficient when there are substantial cor
 relations between the variables in the target distribution\, a challenging 
 setting for MCMC. An important motivating application of MIIS occurs when t
 he exact Gibbs sampler is not available because it is infeasible to directl
 y simulate from the conditional distributions. In this case the MIIS method
   can be much more efficient than a Metropolis-within-Gibbs approach. We al
 so introduce the MIIS random walk algorithm\, designed to accelerate conver
 gence and improve upon the computational efficiency of standard random walk
  samplers. Simulated and empirical illustrations for Bayesian analysis show
  that the method significantly reduces the variance of  Monte Carlo estimat
 es compared to standard MCMC approaches\, at equivalent implementation and 
 computational effort.

DESCRIPTION:Title: A Simple Under-Identification Tes for Linear IV-Models\,
  with an Application to Dynamic Panel Data Models\n\nAbstract: For linear I
 V models it is shown that standard under-identification tests like the Crag
 g-Donald and Kleibergen-Paap tests are Sargan type tests for instrument-err
 or orthogonality in the linear IV model of one endogenous explanatory varia
 ble regressed on the others\, estimated by LIML. This insight can then be u
 sed to extend these type of tests to more complex data structures\, like dy
 namic panel data models\, leading to very simple to calculate tests for und
 er-identification.

DESCRIPTION:Title:  Monotonicity in IV and fuzzy RD designs - A Guide to Pr
 actice\n\nAbstract: \nWhenever treatment effects are heterogeneous and ther
 e is sorting into treatment based on the gain\, monotonicity is a condition
  that both Instrumental Variable and fuzzy Regression Discontinuity designs
  have to satisfy for their estimate to be interpretable as a LATE. However\
 , applied economic work rarely discusses this important assumption.  We pro
 vide insights in how to think about monotonicity. While there is no test of
  monotonicity in itself\, the joint hypotheses of independence and monotoni
 city lead to testable implications. Yet\, these implications are necessary 
 but not sufficient for independence and monotonicity to hold. Therefore\, w
 e argue that monotonicity can and should be investigated using a mix of eco
 nomic intuition and data patterns\, just like other untestable assumptions 
 in an IV or fuzzy RD design. We provide examples in a variety of settings a
 s a guide to practice. We also discuss recent theoretical work that either 
 develops alternative tests or attempts to replace monotonicity with weaker 
 assumptions.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Graph-based change-point test for high-dimensional data\
 n\nAbstract: A change-point test for high-dimensional data is presented by 
 using a Bayesian-type statistic based on the shortest Hamiltonian path\, an
 d the change-point is estimated by using ratio cut. A permutation procedure
  is applied to approximate the significance of Bayesian-type statistics. Th
 e change-point test is proven to be consistent\, and an error probability i
 n change-point estimation is provided. The test is powerful against alterna
 tives with a shift in variance and is accurate in change-point estimation\,
  as shown in simulation studies. Its applicability in tracking cell divisio
 n is illustrated. Our other graph-based change-tests will also be briefly i
 ntroduced.

DESCRIPTION:<b>Title:</b> Forecasting the European Carbon Market Return Usi
 ng Data Reduction Techniques<br><br><b>&nbsp\;Abstract: </b>This paper exam
 ines whether the European Carbon Market Return can be forecast at the weekl
 y horizon. A wide range of potential predictors are considered including ot
 her Energy returns\, non-energy commodity returns and returns on other fina
 ncial assets. Data reduction techniques are examined following Kim and Swan
 son (2014) including Principal components to generate factors and shrinkage
  methods (Bayesian model averaging\, statistical learning and penalized reg
 ression) to select functions and weights for the factors. We generally find
  that the data reduction techniques are effective for the Carbon market ret
 urn both in improving forecast accuracy and in generating abnormal returns 
 in a portfolio allocation exercise. In terms of forecast accuracy improveme
 nts of around 2-3% at a one-week horizon is possible over the benchmark whi
 ch is statistically significant using tests of equal forecast accuracy (CW 
 test\, MSE-F test) and encompassing (ENC-NEW). In terms of economic value w
 e consider the optimal portfolio allocation of a mean-variance optimising i
 nvestor between the risk-free rate and the carbon market. Initial results i
 ndicate that annualised utility gains of 10% are feasible where portfolio w
 eights are restricted to be between 0 and 1 or as much as 20% when leverage
  of 50% is allowed and weights in each asset are between -0.5 and 1.5.&nbsp

DESCRIPTION:Title: Does the Future Have an Ancient Heart? Evidence on the O
 rigins of Savings\n\nAbstract: This study investigates the channels of hist
 orical persistence in savings. A simple theoretical model predicts that sav
 ings persists indirectly through risk and time preferences\, and directly t
 hrough formal financial institutions. Using a spatial regression discontinu
 ity\, I test the theoretical predictions with experimental and survey data 
 collected across the Habsburg-Ottoman imperial border in present-day Romani
 a. The results confirm persistence in savings\, with higher savings in form
 er Habsburg regions. Savings legacies do not transmit through preferences\,
  but rather through differential financial access. Alternative mechanisms\,
  such as cultural savings norms or trust in financial institutions\, are ru
 led out\, while falsification tests reject pseudo effects. Evidence indicat
 es that savings mitigates household economic shocks\, suggesting important 
 contemporaneous consequences of savings legacies.

DESCRIPTION:Title:  How Well Does “Core” CPI Capture Permanent Price Change
 s?\n \nAbstract:  Does a measure excluding food and energy prices from the 
 overall consumer price index (CPI) capture the persistent partof the CPI?  
 In order to examine thisclaim we decompose “core” (excluding food and energ
 y) CPI and the food andenergy CPI measures into permanent and transitory co
 mponents using a correlated unobserved components model. We findthat shocks
  to the permanent component of core CPI are more volatile than shocks to co
 re CPI.  This is possible because the permanent and transitory shocks to co
 re CPI are highly negatively correlated.  We further find that the excluded
  food and energy components have important permanent components that are no
 t captured by core CPI.  We examine impulse response functions and find tha
 t overall CPI inflation responds more sharply to shocks than core CPI infla
 tion\, and after the first year the impactof shocks on overall inflation is
  less than the impact on core inflation. In conclusion we find that core CP
 I is not smooth because it excludes volatile temporary movements but rather
  because it experiences volatile permanent shocks with off setting transito
 ry movements.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Efficient estimation in semivarying coefficient models f
 or longitudinal/clustered data\n\nAbstract: In semivarying coefficient mode
 ling of longitudinal/clustered data\, usually of primary interest is the pa
 rametric component which involves unknown constant coefficients.\nWe first 
 study semiparametric efficiency bound for estimation of the constant coeffi
 cients in a general setup. It can be achieved by spline regression provided
  that the within-cluster covariance matrices are known\, which is an unreal
 istic assumption. Thus\, we propose an estimator of the constant coefficien
 ts when the covariance matrices are unknown and depend only on the index va
 riable and under the identity link function. After preliminary estimation b
 ased on working independence\, we estimate the covariance matrices by apply
 ing local linear regression to the resultant residuals. Using the covarianc
 e matrix estimates\, we employ spline regression to obtain our final estima
 tor of  the constant coefficients. The proposed estimator achieves the semi
 parametric efficiency bound under normality assumption\, and it has the sma
 llest asymptotic covariance matrix among a class of estimators even when no
 rmality is violated. Finite sample performance of our estimator is examined
  and compared with the working independence estimator and some existing met
 hod via simulations and a real data example.

DESCRIPTION:Abstract: This paper considers panel data regression models wit
 h residuals generated by a multifactor error structure and regressors that 
 are not necessarily strongly exogenous. In such cases\, the standard dynami
 c panel estimators fail to provide consistent estimates of the parameters. 
 We propose a new estimation procedure\, based on instrumental variables\, w
 hich retains the traditional attractive features of method of moments estim
 ators. The novelty of our approach is that we introduce new parameters to r
 epresent the unobserved covariances between the instruments and the factor 
 component of the residual\; these parameters are typically estimable when N
 is large. Some important estimation and identification issues are studied 
 in detail. The finite-sample performance of our estimator is investigated u

 e estimates of the parameters over various parameterizations.<br>\n<a href=

DESCRIPTION:AdaptSpect: Estimation of Time Varying Spectrum\n\nABSTRACT\n\n
 In many practical problems\, time series are realizations of nonstationary 
 random processes.These processes can often be modeled as processes with slo
 wly changing dynamics or as piecewise stationary processes. In these cases\
 , various approaches to estimating the time-varying spectral density have b
 een proposed. Our approach in this paper is to estimate local log spectra u
 sing a Bayesian mixture of splines. The basic idea of our approach is to fi
 rst partition the data into small sections. We then assume that the log spe
 ctral density of the evolutionary process in any given partition is a mixtu
 re of individual log spectra. We use a mixture of smoothing splines model t
 o estimate the evolutionary log spectrum. The mixture model is fit using Ma
 rkov chain Monte Carlo techniques that yield estimates of the log spectra o
 f the individual subsections\, as well as pointwise credible intervals for 
 the unknown log spectrum. We use a reversible jump step to automatically de
 termine the number of different spectral components. We illustrate the meth
 odology by applying the approach to two real examples.\n\nhttp://www.mbs.ed

DESCRIPTION:Title:\n\nSimultaneous equation models with discrete outcomes: 
 Coherence and completeness using panel data.\n\nAbstract: \n\nExtending the
  simultaneous equations approach to jointly determined discrete outcomes ha
 s proved to be challenging. One has to impose the so-called coherency condi
 tion to guarantee the existence of a unique reduced form. These conditions 
 effectively convert a model where the endogenous variables are jointly dete
 rmined into a model that is triangular or recursive. In the spirit of a sug
 gestion by Lewbel (2007)\, I propose using panel data to decide how the coh
 erency condition will hold without restricting error supports or imposing t
 riangularity. Furthermore\, incidental parameter biases are avoided and tim
 e-invariant unobserved heterogeneity can now be thought of as an indicator 
 of the direction of causality between the discrete outcomes. Finally\, I ap
 ply the proposal and revisit the model of employment conditions and borrowi
 ng constraints estimated by Hajivassiliou and Ioannides. (2007).

DESCRIPTION:Title: Comparing Deep Neural Network and Econometric Approaches
  to Predicting the Impact of Climate Change on Agricultural Yield\n\nAbstra
 ct: Predicting the impact of climate change on crop yield is difficult\, in
  part because the production function mapping weather to yield is high dime
 nsional and nonlinear. We compare three approaches to predicting yields: (i
 ) deep neural networks (DNNs)\, (ii) traditional panel-data models\, and (i
 ii) a new panel-data model that allows for unit and time fixed-effects in b
 oth intercepts and slopes in the agricultural production function - made fe
 asible by a new estimator developed by Neal (2018) called MO-OLS. Using U.S
 . county-level corn yield data from 1950-2015\, we show that both DNNs and 
 MO-OLS models outperform traditional panel data models for predicting yield
 \, both in-sample and in a Monte Carlo cross-validation exercise. However\,
  the MO-OLS model substantially outperforms both DNNs and traditional panel
 -data models in forecasting yield in a 2006-15 holdout sample. Finally\, we
  compare the predictions of all these models for climate change impacts on 
 corn yield from the present to 2100.

  Professor Rachel Wang<br><br><b>Title</b>: Adaptive conformal classificati
 on with noisy labels<br><br><b>Abstract</b>: Conformal inference provides a
  rigorous statistical framework for uncertainty quantification in machine l
 earning\, enabling well-calibrated prediction sets with precise coverage gu
 arantees for any classification model. However\, its reliance on the ideali
 sed assumption of perfect data exchangeability limits its effectiveness in 
 the presence of real-world complications\, such as low-quality labels -- a 
 widespread issue in modern large-scale data sets. We tackle this open probl
 em by introducing an adaptive conformal inference method capable of efficie
 ntly handling deviations from exchangeability caused by random label noise\
 , leading to informative prediction sets with tight label-conditional and m
 arginal coverage guarantees even in those challenging scenarios. This is ob
 tained through a precise characterisation of the coverage inflation (or def
 lation) suffered by standard conformal inferences in the presence of label 
 contamination\, which is then made actionable through a new calibration alg
 orithm. Our solution can leverage different modelling assumptions about the
  contamination process\, while requiring no knowledge of the underlying dat
 a distribution or of the inner workings of the classification model. The em
 pirical performance of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulati
 ons and real data.</p><p><br>Kind regards<br>Dan\, Ben\, Michael and Klaus<

DESCRIPTION:Title:"Together or Separate? Post-conflict Partition\, Ethnic H
 omogenization\, and <br>the Provision of Public Schooling" \n<br>\nAbstract
 : The partitioning of political jurisdictions is becoming an increasingly c
 ommon component of agreements to end ethnic conflict. While partitions have
  proved to be effective in achieving immediate peace\, their effect on post
 -conflict recovery remains unclear. This paper studies the effects of the p
 artition which ended the 1992-1995 Bosnian War on the post-war provision of
  public goods at the municipality-level. Comparing trends in the provision 
 of public schooling across partitioned and unpartitioned municipalities dur
 ing the 1986-2006 period\, I find that partitioned municipalities provide 5
 8 percent more primary schools and 37 percent more teachers (per capita). I
  also find evidence which suggests that convergent preferences – operating 
 via ethnic politics – for ethnically oriented schools may be an important d
 river of the results\, although I cannot rule out the possibility of mechan
 ical explanations. In addition\, as the increase in public goods provision 
 may be ethnically oriented\, only the ethnic majority profits from this arr
 angement. These findings imply that partitions generate ethnic inequality t
 hat may undermine the sustainability of peace in the long run.<br>\n<a href

DESCRIPTION:Title: When does seasonality change? A Synchrosqueezing approac
 h to analyzing the dynamics of the seasonality.\n\nAbstract:\nSeasonality i
 s a feature aimed to describe the oscillatory pattern\ninside an observed s
 ignal\, for example\, the incidence time series.\nIdentifying seasonality f
 rom a observed noisy signal is an important\nissue in many scientific field
 s\, such as public health and economics.\nSeveral methods\, for example\, s
 easonal autoregressive integrated\nmoving average (SARIMA)\, frequency anal
 ysis (FFT)\, seasonal index\,\nsingular spectrum analysis (SSA)\, etc\, are
  available to identify the\nseasonality. However\, it is not an easy task t
 o analyze the dynamical\nbehavior of the seasonality by these methods. For 
 example\, how to\nquantify the influence of the general appliance of varice
 lla vaccine\non the seasonal behavior of varicella itself and herpes zoster
 ?\nThe purpose of this study is to provide a general model describing the\n
 dynamics of the seasonality and introduce an adaptive method\, referred\nto
  as the Synchrosqueezing transform\, to extract accurately the\nseasonality
  from a given time varying signal. The identifiability\nproblem of the mode
 l and the robustness property of Synchrosqueezing\ntransform to dependent n
 oise is theoretically analyzed. We directly\napply this method to analyze t
 he incidence time series of varicella\nand herpes zoster and show the dynam
 ics of the seasonality introduced\nby the general appliance of varicella va
 ccine. This is joint work with\nYu-Chun Chen and Hau-Tieng Wu.

DESCRIPTION:JUN SUNG KIM (Cornell University)\nURL (with link to CV): http:
 //www.junsungkim.com/\n\nTitle: ''A Structural Model of Multigraph Formatio
 n: Favor Exchange and Social Networks in Villages'\n\nAbstract: This paper 
 proposes a structural model of multigraph formation\, where 1) individuals 
 determine two or more types of links simultaneously\; 2) all networks inter
 act with each other in the sense that the structure of one network affects 
 an individual's utility from the other networks\; and 3) one or more networ
 ks are endogenous but not simultaneous from the econometrician's perspectiv
 e. I extend the notion of pairwise stability of a single network in Jackson
  and Wolinsky (1996) to a multigraph\, and show that the structural model i
 s equivalent to a multinomial choice model under pairwise stability of a mu
 ltigraph. The presence of endogenous but not simultaneously determined netw
 orks is a source of an incomplete econometric model. Relying on the recent 
 development of partially identified econometric models\, I characterize the
  sharp identification region of utility parameters by a finite set of momen
 t inequalities and conduct inference. I apply the model to village networks
  in rural India and find that friendship affects the formation of risk shar
 ing and other favor exchange networks in the same direction. On the other h
 and\, the empirical evidence for caste homophily in risk sharing and favor 
 exchange networks is inconclusive.

 rocedure for the empirical likelihood (EL)\, the exponential tilting (ET)\,
  and the exponentially tilted empirical likelihood (ETEL) estimators. The p
 roposed bootstrap achieves sharp asymptotic refinements for t tests and con
 fidence intervals based on such estimators. Furthermore\, my bootstrap is r
 obust to possible model misspecification\, i.e.\, it achieves asymptotic re
 finements regardless of whether the assumed moment condition model is corre
 ctly specified or not. This result is new\, because asymptotic refinements 
 of the bootstrap for EL estimators have not been established in the literat
 ure even under correct model specification. Monte Carlo simulation results 
 are provided.

DESCRIPTION:We study the changing international transmission of US financia
 l shocks over the\nperiod 1971-2009. Financial shocks are defined as unexpe
 cted changes of a newly\ndeveloped financial conditions index (FCI) for the
  US. We use a time-varying factor-\naugmented VAR (TV-FAVAR) to model the F
 CI jointly with a large set of macro-\neconomic\, financial and trade varia
 bles for nine major advanced countries. We find\nthat expansionary US finan
 cial shocks have a considerable positive impact on growth\nin the countries
  in our dataset\, and vice versa for negative shocks. The transmission\nto 
 GDP growth in the euro-area countries and in Japan has increased gradually 
 since\nthe 1980s\, consistent with globalization. A more marked increase is
  detected in the\nearly 1980s in the US itself and the UK\, consistent with
  structural changes in financial\nmarkets. The size of US financial shocks 
 varies strongly over time\, with the 'global\nfinancial crisis shock' being
  larger than any other financial shock estimated over the\nsample under ana
 lysis and explaining 30-60 percent of the variation in GDP growth in\n2008-
 2009 (compared to a little more than 10 percent on average over the 1971-20
 07\nperiod). A large breakdown in exports contributed to the strong worldwi
 de propagation of US financial shocks during the crisis. Differences in the
  real effects across\ncountries are related to differences in openness\, ba
 nks' capitalization\, the fiscal and\nmonetary policy stance\, and overheat
 ing of the economy prior to the crisis.<br>\n<a href="http://www.bundesbank

DESCRIPTION:Title: Bayesian Semiparametric Modeling of Realized Covariance 
 Matrices\n\nAbstract:  This paper introduces several new Bayesian nonparame
 tric models suitable for capturing the unknown conditional distribution of 
 realized covariance (RCOV) matrices.  Existing dynamic Wishart models are e
 xtended to countably innite mixture models of Wishart and inverse-Wishart d
 istributions. In addition to mixture models with constant weights we propos
 e models with time-varying weights to capture time dependence in the unknow
 n distribution. Each of our models can be combined with returns to provide 
 a coherent joint model of returns and RCOV. The extensive forecast results 
 show the new models provide very signicant improvements in density forecast
 s for RCOV and returns and competitive point forecasts of RCOV.

 tle:\nA new nonparametric stationarity test of time series in time domain\n
 \nAbstract:\nIn this talk\, we present a new double order selection test fo
 r checking second-order stationarity of a time series. To develop the test\
 , a sequence of systematic samples are defined via the Walsh functions. The
 n the deviations of the autocovariances based on these systematic samples f
 rom the corresponding autocovariances of the whole time series are calculat
 ed and the uniformly asymptotic joint normality of these deviations over di
 fferent systematic samples is obtained. With a double order selection schem
 e\, our test statistic is constructed by combining the deviations at differ
 ent lags in the systematic samples. The null asymptotic distribution of the
  proposed statistic is derived and the consistency of the test is shown und
 er fixed and local alternatives. Simulation studies demonstrate well-behave
 d finite sample properties of the proposed method. Favorable comparisons wi
 th the test of Dette et al. (2011) in terms of power are shown analytically
  and illustrated empirically. In addition\, the proposed method is applied 
 to check the stationarity assumption of a chemical process viscosity readin
 gs data.

 Title</b>: Designing experiments when the goal is getting the right treatme
 nts to the right people<br><br><b>Abstract</b>:  I consider designs for exp
 eriments with multiple treatment conditions\, in which the experimental pla
 nner wishes to use the experimental data to learn a policy or assignment re
 gime for assigning treatment to subjects in the future. For example\, a cam
 paign may want to know which advertisement to run\, or which advertisements
  to target to key subgroups. Possibly\, they also care about testing hypoth
 eses with respect to this policy. This problem requires the planner to dete
 rmine both experimental treatment allocation procedures (possibly based on 
 adaptive algorithms) and assignment recommendation procedures using experim
 ental data. Testing hypotheses about learned policies requires consideratio
 ns for selective inference. <br><br>Kind regards<br>Dan\, Ben\, Michael and

DESCRIPTION:Title: Bayesian Inference for Structural Vector Autoregressions
  Identified by Markov-Switching Heteroskedasticity\n\nAbstract: In this stu
 dy\, Bayesian inference is developed for structural vector autoregressive m
 odels in which the structural parameters are identified via Markov-switchin
 g heteroskedasticity. In such a model\, restrictions that are just-identify
 ing in the homoskedastic case\, become over-identifying and can be tested. 
 A set of parametric restrictions is derived under which the structural matr
 ix is globally or partially identified and a Savage-Dickey density ratio is
  used to assess the validity of the identification conditions. For that pur
 pose\, a new probability distribution is defined that generalizes the beta\
 , F\, and compound gamma distributions. As an empirical example\, monetary 
 models are compared using heteroskedasticity as an additional device for id
 entification. \nThe empirical results support models with money in the inte
 rest rate reaction function.\n\nThis is joint work with Helmut Lutkepohl

DESCRIPTION:Title: "Forecast combination in discrete choice models: predict
 ing FOMC monetary policy decisions" <br>\n<br>\nAbstract: This paper provid
 es a new methodology to combine forecasts based on several univariate discr
 ete choice models. This is achieved primarily by combining one-step-ahead f
 orecast of probabilities associated\nwith each univariate model. The paper 
 applies well-established scoring techniques for qualitative response models
  in the context of forecast\ncombination. Log-scores and quadratic-scores a
 re used both to evaluate the forecasting performance of each model and to c
 ombine the\nforecasted probabilities. This new methodology is applied to fo
 recast\nthe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decisions in changing\nthe
  federal funds target rate. Several of the economic fundamentals\ninfluenci
 ng the FOMC decisions are nonstationary over time and are\nmodelled in a si
 milar fashion to Hu and Phillips (2004\, JoE). The empirical results show t
 hat combining forecasted probabilities using scores\nmostly outperforms bot
 h equal weight combination and forecasts based\non multivariate models.\n<b

 span> </span></p><p><b>Abstract</b>: <span>Teaching business-related course
 s in today's fast-paced environment comes with its own set of unique challe
 nges and opportunities. The ever-evolving business landscape demands an app
 roach that goes beyond traditional teaching </span><span>and assessment mod
 els</span><span> to incorporate</span><span> </span><span>real-world releva
 nce</span><span>\, industry </span><span>experiences\, and hands-on learnin
 g</span><span>.</span><span> This is essential for equipping students with 
 the skills needed to navigate the complex business world and excel in their
  future careers.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p><br><p>The UNSW Busi
 ness School embraced these challenges as opportunities\, innovating our edu
 cation practices to meet these evolving demands. In this seminar\, Associat
 e Professor Kevin Liu will share two education innovations implemented at U
 NSW\, focusing on strategies that make academic learning directly relevant 
 to real-world applications and motivate the next generation of business pro
 fessionals to actively create solutions to real-world challenges. </p><br><
 p>The first innovation\, StoryWall\, moves beyond traditional assessment mo
 dels by replacing summative mid-term exams or weekly quizzes with a formati
 ve assessment approach that co-creates authentic learning experiences and f
 eedback. Utilising an online discussion forum architecture\, StoryWall enco
 urages collaborative exploration of authentic issues\, industry insights\, 
 and research\, thereby creating an engaging and dynamic learning environmen
 t that not only improves the student learning experience but also provides 
 regular\, targeted feedback at scale. Since its introduction in 2019\, Stor
 yWall has been integrated into more than 40 UNSW courses across multiple sc
 hools and faculties\, benefiting more than 12\,000 undergraduate and postgr
 aduate students\, and has received overwhelmingly positive feedback from bo
 th students and academics. </p><br><p>The second innovation\, Sandbox\, pio
 neered by the UNSW Sandbox Program (unsw.to/sandbox)\, provides a platform 
 that empowers tripartite collaboration among academics\, industry\, and stu
 dents\, enabling them to co-develop solutions for contemporary business and
  societal challenges. Through transforming existing university courses into
  immersive 'Sandboxes'\, this innovation tackles the crucial issue of scala
 bility in Work-Integrated Learning (WIL) by facilitating tripartite collabo
 ration at scale. Through the innovative Sandbox framework\, the Program has
  transformed 25 undergraduate and postgraduate courses across multiple disc
 iplines into real-world ‘Sandboxes’ for over 7\,800 students in less than 3
  years. These students worked directly with academics in the UNSW Business 
 School and over 160 industry practitioners to tackle more than 70 wicked pr
 oblems\, generating impact across education\, research\, and social engagem
 ent. </p><br><p>This seminar will present the design principles\, implement
 ation experiences\, and evaluation outcomes of these innovations\, providin
 g opportunities for academics to discuss and explore new pedagogical strate
 gies in fostering authentic\, engaging\, and industry-relevant learning exp
 eriences for students. </p><p><b>Speaker Bio</b>:<i> </i><span><i>Dr Kevin

DESCRIPTION:Abstract:<br />\nKaggle is a global platform for data predictio
 n competitions allowing researchers and companies to post their problem and
  have it scrutinised by the world's statisticians and computer scientists. 
 <br />\n\nBy exposing a problem to a wide range of analysts and techniques\
 , data prediction competitions turn out to be great way to get the most out
  of a dataset\, given its inherent noise and richness. For example\, Kaggle
  has been running a bioinformatics competition requiring participants to pi
 ck markers in HIV's genetic sequence that predict a change in viral load (a
  measure of the severity of infection). Within a week and a half\, the best
  submission had already outdone the best methods in the scientific literatu
 re. <br /><br />\n\nBio:\nBefore founding Kaggle in 2009\, Anthony worked i
 n the macroeconomic modelling areas of the Reserve Bank of Australia and th
 e Australian Treasury. During an internship at The Economist magazine in 20
 08\, Anthony wrote an article about the use of data-driven decision making 
 by companies. He became so fascinated by the power of data that he left his
  day-job as an econometrician to found Kaggle.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Volatility timing and portfolio selection: How best to f
 orecast volatility\n\nAbstract: Within the context of volatility timing and
  portfolio selection this paper considers how best to estimate a volatility
  model. Two issues are dealt with\, namely the frequency of data used to co
 nstruct volatility estimates\, and the loss function used to estimate the p
 arameters of a volatility model. We find support for the use of intraday da
 ta for estimating volatility which is consistent with earlier research. We 
 also find that the choice of loss function is important and show that a sim
 ple mean squared error loss\, overall provides the best forecasts of volati
 lity upon which to form optimal portfolios.\n\n<a href="http://staff.qut.ed

DESCRIPTION:Title: Using information about technologies\, markets and firm 
 behaviour to decompose a proper productivity index\n\nAbstract: This paper 
 uses distance functions to define new output and input quantity indexes tha
 t satisfy important axioms from index number theory (e.g.\, identity\, tran
 sitivity\, proportionality and time-space reversal). Dividing the output in
 dex by the input index yields a new productivity index that can be decompos
 ed into a measure of technical change\, a measure of environmental change\,
  and several measures of efficiency change. A problem with this new index i
 s that it cannot be computed without estimating the production frontier. Th
 e paper shows how assumptions concerning technologies\, markets and firm be
 haviour can be used to inform the estimation process. The focus is on the a
 symptotic properties of least squares estimators when the explanatory varia
 bles in the production frontier model are endogenous. In this case\, the or
 dinary least squares estimator is usually inconsistent. However\, there is 
 one situation where it is super-consistent. A fully-modified ordinary least
  squares estimator is also available in this case. To illustrate the main i
 deas\, the paper uses national accounts data from 30 countries to estimate 
 a stochastic production frontier. The parameter estimates are then used to 
 obtain estimates of the economically- relevant components of productivity c
 hange.

DESCRIPTION:Title: A New Nonparametric Specification Test for the Drift of 
 the Short-Term Interest Rate Process\n\nAbstract:\nThe drift of the short t
 erm interest rate process has a crucial role both in capturing the time-ser
 ies behavior and in pricing the cross section of interest rate claims. This
  has drawn attention to the shape of the drift. Empirical evidence from mod
 el specification test in Ait-sahalia (1996) suggests that the drift functio
 n of the short rate process is nonlinear. The findings of a nonlinear drift
  have\, however been challenged by Chapman and Pearson (2000). The Monte Ca
 rlo simulations show that the nonparametric drift function estimator propos
 ed by Stanton (1997) can produce spurious nonlinearities even when the drif
 t function is truly linear. This motivates Sam and Jiang (2009) to propose 
 a new nonparametric estimator of the drift function in the short rate proce
 ss. The proposed estimator can greatly reduce the finite sample bias of the
  nonparametric estimator of the drift function proposed by Stanton (1997). 
 \n\nBased on the new nonparametric estimator of the drift function proposed
  by Sam and Jiang (2009)\, we propose a new consistent test for the paramet
 ric specificaion of the drift funcion in a short term interest rate process
  using observations from a panel of yields. The data are assumed to be samp
 led discretely in a time interval that can be fixed or lengthened to infini
 ty. The test statistic is shown to follow an asymptotic normal distribution
  under the null hypothesis that the parametric diffusion function is correc
 tly specified.

 pan></span></span><span>Heterogeneous effects of welfare reforms on earning
 s\, transfers\, and income have been established theoretically and empirica
 lly. Evaluation studies often focus on quantile treatment effects (QTE)\, w
 hich rely on the marginal distributions of potential treatment and control 
 outcomes. Parameters that depend on the joint distribution of potential out
 comes\, such as quantiles of the distribution of treatment effects (QDTE)\,
  receive less attention. We propose a strategy to identify these parameters
 . We leverage the property that\, under random assignment\, rank correlatio
 n coefficients between actual treatment and predicted control state outcome
 s are identical\, irrespective of whether predictions are based on treatmen
 t or control units. To identify QDTE\, we assume that all permutations of o
 bservation units satisfying this property are equally likely. Rearranging q
 uantiles yields a generalized version of quantile treatment effects (GQTE).
  We employ a reweighting approach for identification under strong ignorabil
 ity. We test the predictor strength and demonstrate that highly predictive 
 covariates yield unbiased\, consistent\, and asymptotically normal estimato
 rs. Our analysis of Connecticut’s Jobs First program reveals initial income
  increases for a larger fraction of participants than previously recognized
 . Long-term gains were at least twice as large as those derived from conven
 tional QTE and concentrated at the lower end of the distribution.</span><br

DESCRIPTION:Title: The Impact of Fertility on Mothers’ Labour Supply in Aus
 tralia: Evidence from Exogenous Variation in Family Size\n\nAbstract: This 
 paper estimates the impact of fertility on mothers’ labour supply in Austra
 lia\, using exogenous variation in family size generated by twin births and
  the gender mix of siblings. Results show that having more than one child d
 ecreases labour market participation by 15.5 percentage points and hours wo
 rked by around 6 hours per week. Having more than two children reduces labo
 ur market participation by between 12 and 20 percentage points and hours wo
 rked by between 3 and 8 hours a week\, depending on the instrument used. In
 terestingly\, fathers also reduce both their labour market participation (b
 y 10 percentage points) and their number of hours worked per week (by 4 hou
 rs) when having more than one child. Compared with the results obtained wit
 h the same methodology for other countries\, the effects for Australia are 
 large\, which partly reflects the constraints on public childcare and the l
 ack of a national paid parental leave scheme prior to 2011.\n\n<a href="htt

DESCRIPTION:A brown bag lunch seminar\n\n“A multiple testing approach to th
 e regularisation of large sample correlation matrices”\nwhich is joint work
  with M. Hashem Pesaran (University of Southern California and Trinity Coll
 ege\, Cambridge) and L. Vanessa Smith (University of York).\n \nAbstract:\n
 This paper proposes a regularisation method for the estimation of large cov
 ariance matrices that uses insights from the multiple testing (MT) literatu
 re. The approach tests the statistical significance of individual pair-wise
  correlations and sets to zero those elements that are not statistically si
 gnificant\, taking account of the multiple testing nature of the problem. B
 y using the inverse of the normal distribution at a predetermined significa
 nce level\, it circumvents the challenge of estimating the theoretical cons
 tant arising in the rate of convergence of existing thresholding estimators
 \, and hence it is easy to implement and does not require cross-validation.
  The MT estimator of the sample correlation matrix is shown to be consisten
 t in the spectral and Frobenius norms\, and in terms of support recovery\, 
 so long as the true covariance matrix is sparse. The performance of the pro
 posed MT estimator is compared to a number of other estimators in the liter
 ature using Monte Carlo experiments. It is shown that the MT estimator perf
 orms well and tends to outperform the other estimators\, particularly when 
 the cross section dimension\, N\, is larger than the time series dimension\
 , T.

 stimation of Copula Models with Discrete Margins via Bayesian Data Augmenta
 tion\n\nAbstract: Estimation of copula models with discrete margins is know
 n to be difficult beyond the bivariate case. We show how this can be achiev
 ed by augmenting the likelihood with latent variables\, and computing infer
 ence using the resulting augmented posterior. To evaluate this we propose t
 wo efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling schemes. One generates the l
 atent variables as a block using a Metropolis-Hasting step with a proposal 
 that is close to its target distribution\, the other generates them one at 
 a time. Our method applies to all parametric copulas where the conditional 
 copula functions can be evaluated\, not just elliptical copulas as in previ
 ous Bayesian work. Moreover\, the copula parameters can be estimated joint 
 with any marginal parameters. We establish the effectiveness of the estimat
 ion method by modeling consumer behavior in online retail using Archimedean
  and Gaussian copulas. The example shows that elliptical copulas can be poo
 r at modeling dependence in discrete data\, just as they can be in the cont
 inuous case. To demonstrate the potential in higher dimensions we estimate 
 16 dimensional D-vine copulas for a longitudinal model of usage of a bicycl
 e path in the city of Melbourne\, Australia. The estimates reveal an intere
 sting serial dependence structure that can be represented in a parsimonious
  fashion using Bayesian selection of independence pair-copula components. F
 inally\, we extend our results and method to the case where some margins ar
 e discrete and others continuous.

 nTitle:\nEstimating the Dimensionality of Latent Structural Models \n\nAbst
 ract:\nPublic opinion scholar Philip Converse once wrote that political ide
 ological belief systems "have often served as primary exhibits for the doct
 rine that what is important to study cannot be measured and that what can b
 e measured is not important to study." An important and often unfortunate c
 haracteristic of the social and behavioral sciences is that most theories d
 epend heavily on the classification of units according to such difficult to
  measure abstract latent constructs --- such as  ideology\, religiosity\, s
 ocioeconomic status\, economic development\, and corruption --- which defy 
 direct\, objective observation.  Recovering these underlying (continuous) t
 raits or (categorical) types requires the specification of a structural mod
 el that relates the many observed indicators which partially reflect the ab
 stract concepts to a very specific structure of underlying latent variables
 .  \n\nBut one of the many requirements for these models is that the dimens
 ionality of these latent variables\, which is often subject to debate\, is 
 known a priori.  As Peter Green poignantly observed\, "one of the things yo
 u do not know is the number of things you do not know." Directly assessing 
 the dimensionality though is often quite difficult\; consequently\, researc
 hers frequently resort to comparing measures of fit for separately estimate
 d models\, with the limitation that one can only consider a few specificati
 ons.  \n\nIn this paper\, I focus on models applied to binary and ordered o
 bserved items and allow for either an unordered or ordered structure among 
 discrete typologies (latent classes). The Bayesian latent class model appli
 ed here  simultaneously determines the number of latent categories as well 
 as the classification of units to the categories.  In this implementation\,
  the number of classes is determined within the model through a random jump
  Markov Chain Monte Carlo step.  Applications include the  political ideolo
 gy type of survey respondents\, coalitions of legislators and the typology 
 of the political regimes of countries.

 tion for Panel Outcomes with an Application to Earnings Effects of Maternit

 ract: \nChild birth leads to a break in a woman’s employment history and is
  considered one reason for the relatively poor labor market outcomes observ
 ed for women compared to men. However\, the time spent at home varies signi
 ficantly across women. The decision to return to work is likely driven by o
 bserved and more importantly unobserved factors that also affect labor mark
 et outcomes directly. \nIn this paper we exploit the variation in time spen
 t at home as a result of a recent change in the parental leave policy in Au
 stria  in the context of a Bayesian treatment effects models for binary tre
 atment and panel outcomes.\nWe propose two modeling frameworks based on the
  potential outcome framework that differ in their modeling of the endogenei
 ty of the treatment and the panel structure of the earnings\, the first bas
 ed on the modeling tradition of the Roy switching regression\, and the seco
 nd based on the factor approach. We discuss how stochastic variable selecti
 on can be implemented within both modeling frameworks and can be used for e
 xample to test for the heterogeneity of the treatment effects. Our empirica
 l analysis of the panel earnings effects from long maternity leave is based
  on a large sample of mothers the Austrian Social Security Register (ASSD).

 ural tontines as outlined in Milevsky and Salisbury's work from 2015. By ex
 amining these products\, we will demonstrate that tontine benefits are pref
 erred over annuity benefits across all utility preferences that maintain th

 vior modification<br><br><b>Abstract</b>:<br><br>Many internet platforms th
 at collect behavioral big data use it to predict user behavior for internal
  purposes and for their business customers (e.g.\, advertisers\, insurers\,
  security forces\, governments\, political consulting firms) who utilize th
 e predictions for personalization\, targeting\, and other decision-making. 
 Improving predictive accuracy is therefore extremely valuable. Data science
  researchers design algorithms\, models\, and approaches to improve predict
 ion. Prediction is also improved with larger and richer data. Beyond improv
 ing algorithms and data\, platforms can stealthily achieve better predictio
 n accuracy by pushing users’ behaviors towards their predicted values\, usi
 ng behavior modification techniques\, thereby demonstrating more certain pr
 edictions. Such apparent ‘‘improved’’ prediction can result from employing 
 reinforcement learning algorithms that combine prediction and behavior modi
 fication. This strategy is absent from the machine learning and statistics 
 literature. Investigating its properties requires integrating causal with p
 redictive notation. To this end\, we incorporate Pearl’s causal do(.) opera
 tor into the predictive vocabulary. We then decompose the expected predicti
 on error given behavior modification and identify the components impacting 
 predictive power. Our derivation elucidates implications of such behavior m
 odification to data scientists\, platforms\, their customers\, and the huma
 ns whose behavior is manipulated. Behavior modification can make users’ beh
 avior more predictable and even more homogeneous\; yet this apparent predic
 tability might not generalize when business customers use predictions in pr
 actice. Outcomes pushed towards their predictions can be at odds with custo
 mers’ intentions\, and harmful to manipulated users.<br><br>Kind regards<br

DESCRIPTION:Title: Copula Modeling of Dependence in Multivariate Time Serie
 s\n \nAbstract\nNonlinear models are increasingly preferred over linear one
 s in multivariate time series analysis. However\, almost all such models re
 main linear at any given point in time\, or conditional on latent regime va
 riables. In this paper an alternative is proposed\, where nonlinear serial 
 and cross-sectional dependence is accounted for directly using a copula mod
 el. A D-vine copula is used for the joint distribution of the series\, whic
 h is a product of bivariate `pair-copulas'.  By blocking these pair-copulas
  together\, the conditional and marginal densities of the multivariate time
  series can be expressed analytically\, and simple conditions for stationar
 ity derived. The copula representation also has the advantage that it is pa
 rsimonious for series that are Markovian. A parallel algorithm for computin
 g the likelihood is given\, along with a Bayesian approach for computing th
 e full range of inference\, including predictive distributions. A two level
  model selection prior is employed\, where the first level places point mas
 s on the Markov order\, and the second accounts for multiplicity in the num
 ber of pair-copulas in each block. The resulting model average estimates of
  the dependence structure are shown to be more accurate in a simulation stu
 dy. Two five-dimensional time series from the Australian electricity market
  are examined. The first shows how the approach extends existing copula mod
 els for multivariate extremes to also account for serial dependence\, while
  the second illustrates the flexibility of the proposed nonlinear time seri
 es model.

 p><span>(</span><span><i>joint work with Madhavi Bajekal and Steven Haberma

 dard tool used by demographers to understand and communicate the contributi
 on of different factors to the evolution of demographic metrics. Despite th
 eir widespread use in demography\, decomposition methods are less commonly 
 used by actuaries. In this paper we develop a new approach for decomposing 
 mortality improvement rate assumptions into the contribution of different c
 auses of death. In particular\, we show how we can decompose a Generalized-
 Age-Period-Cohort (GAPC) mortality improvement rate model into the additive
  contribution of different causes of death. The methods introduced in this 
 paper are useful for the communication of mortality improvement assumptions
  to users and decision makers and for shedding light into understanding the
  drivers of mortality change.  In addition\, the decomposition approach ope
 ns up new possibilities for deriving mortality projection using GAPC models
 . In particular\, the combination of this decomposition approach with forec
 ast reconciliation methods has the potential to improve the accuracy of all
 -cause mortality projections. We illustrate the decomposition methods using
  U.S. mortality data by cause of death for the period 1959-2019.</span></p>

  Robust Regression Discontinuity Extrapolation<br><br><b>Abstract</b>: This
  paper studies the identification and estimation of regression discontinuit
 y (RD) extrapolation processes that measure policy effects away from the ru
 nning variable cutoff. Our proposed semi-parametric identification strategy
  uses weaker assumptions than those previously adopted in the literature an
 d\, at the same time\, enjoys a new robustness property of reducing to clas
 sic nonparametric RD identification when the magnitude of extrapolation goe
 s to zero. We applied our proposed method to extend the empirical analysis 
 in Lindo et al. (2010} on college academic probation. Our method allows us 
 to estimate the effect of academic probation for students not exactly at th
 e probation GPA cutoff.<br><br>Kind regards<br>Dan\, Ben\, Michael and Klau

 r>Abstract: </span></span></span></span></span></span>The equilibrium clima
 te sensitivity (ECS) is a key parameter in climate science and other discip
 lines. This study estimates ECS as a common equilibrium parameter across en
 ergy balance models (EBMs). Fitting EBMs to simulated data from 31 climate 
 models under a CO2 quadrupling experiment\, we introduce a Bayesian composi
 te likelihood approach to simultaneously integrate and estimate all the con
 stituent EBMs. Complementing methods of storylines and emergent constraints
  commonly employed by climate scientists\, our econometric alternative prov
 ides a data-driven ECS estimator. We find an ECS estimate of 3.65K\, charac
 terized by a unimodal and right-skewed posterior distribution that facilita
 tes uncertainty quantification. Our approach also yields a 95% credible int
 erval of (2.5K\, 5K)\, which is narrower and closer to the upper bound of t
 he IPCC’s “very likely” ECS range.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Triangular semiparametric models featuring two dependent
  endogenous binary outcomes <br>\nAbstract: This paper addresses the estima
 tion of a class of models which features two endogenous and dependent binar
 y outcomes. This class includes the triangular model with a binary outcome 
 and a binary treatment\, and several interesting variants on the sample sel
 ection model. The structure of the model imposes no distributional assumpti
 ons on the disturbances nor does it require that they enter additively. We 
 formulate a quasi maximum likelihood estimator with semiparametric componen
 ts that incorporate several bias adjustments. Under these adjustments\, we 
 establish desirable large sample properties using regular kernels in place 
 of higher order kernels. Simulation evidence conrms that this estimator pe
 rforms well in nite samples.<br>\n\n<a href="http://www9.georgetown.edu/fa

DESCRIPTION:Title: Additional Conditional Moment Tests\n\nAbstract: The pri
 mary focus of this article is the provision of tests for additional conditi
 onal moment constraints in cross-section or short panel data contexts. The 
 principal contribution is the explicit incorporation of conditional moment 
 restrictions defining the maintained hypothesis in the formulation of the t
 est statistics thus mirroring that of the classical parametric likelihood s
 etting by defining restricted tests in contradistinction to unrestricted te
 sts that partially or completely ignore the maintained moment condition inf
 ormation. The framework is quite general allowing the parameters defining t
 he additional and maintained conditional moment restrictions to differ and 
 permitting the conditioning variates to differ likewise. GMM and generalize
 d empirical likelihood test statistics are suggested. The asymptotic proper
 ties of the statistics are described under both null hypothesis and a suita
 ble sequence of local alternatives. An extensive set of simulation experime
 nts explores the practical efficacy of the various test statistics in terms
  of empirical size and size-adjusted power confirming the superiority of re
 stricted over unrestricted tests. A number of restricted tests possess both
  sufficiently satisfactory empirical size and power characteristics to allo
 w their recommendation for econometric practice.

 actionary monetary policy shocks improve income inequality\, when we focus 
 on the re-distributive effect beyond the negative aggregate level effect\, 
 by reducing the number of low and high income people while increasing the n
 umber of middle income people\; however\, contractionary monetary policy sh
 ocks worsen income inequality when the aggregate income shift is taken into
  account. Second\, shocks to income distribution potentially have a substan

DESCRIPTION:Title: On the Computational Complexity of Data Analysis in Spac
 es of Curves\n\nAbstract:\nTime series data is one of the most common forms
  of big data. More generally\, we can think of sequence data such as trajec
 tories of moving objects and other geometric curves. Modern data analysis n
 eeds to be able to take such sequences or time series as input. In particul
 ar\, we need to be able to perform basic tasks such as clustering and class
 ification on distributions of curves. The Frechet distance and is a well-st
 udied geometric distance measure for curves that shares similarities with t
 he popular dynamic time warping (DTW) distance. There is a large body of re
 search on the complexity of computing and approximating the Frechet distanc
 e and DTW\, however it has a strong focus on computing single distances. Th
 is ignores the larger context in which the distance computation is usually 
 invoked: clustering\, nearest-neighbor searching and range searching. In my
  talk I will describe some recent work in this area.\n\n\nBio: \nAnne Driem
 el received her PhD from Utrecht University in the Netherlands. She is assi
 stant professor in the group on data mining at the Eindhoven Technical Univ
 ersity. Her work is supported by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientifi
 c Research (NWO) through a Veni grant with the title "Clustering time serie
 s and trajectories". Her work focuses on the computational complexity of fi
 nding structure in curve data.

 to support government bond market function over early 2020\, the yield targ
 et on 3-year Australian government bonds\, and the bond purchase programme 
 to lower longer-term yields from late 2020 through early 2022. For purchase
 s to support market function\, we find that the announcement lowered short-
 dated Australian Government Securities (AGS) yields but did not lower longe
 r-dated AGS yields. We also find that purchases led to lower yields as and 
 when they were implemented and that they supported market function by lower
 ing bid–offer spreads. For the yield target\, we find a substantial announc
 ement effect and moderate implementation effects on yields. Conversely\, th
 e yield target appears to have detrimentally affected some aspects of the b
 ond market function. For the bond purchase programme\, we find an announcem
 ent effect of approximately 30 basis points for longer-term AGS yields\; ho
 wever\, any implementation effects were small and temporary.</p><p>The pape

 nURL (with link to CV): http://home.uchicago.edu/~dkozbur/\n\nTitle: 'Infer
 ence in Additively Seperable Models with a High Dimensional Component''\n\n
 Abstract: This paper provides inference results for series estimators with 
 a high\ndimensional component. This allows\, for example\, estimation of a 
 nonlinear response\nof an outcome variable given a treatment variable of in
 terest while accounting for\npotentially very many confounders. This paper 
 considers a variable selection procedure\nfor choosing confounding terms th
 at generalizes the post-double selection procedure\ngiven in Belloni\, Cher
 nozhukov\, Hansen (2013) to the nonparametric setting. In one\nstage\, vari
 ables are selected if they are relevant for predicting the treatment. In a\
 nsecond stage\, variables are selected if they are relevant in predicting t
 he treatment\nregressor of interest. The proposed method therefore formaliz
 es considerations for\ntrading o estimation precision with omitted variable
 s bias for the impact of a variable\nof interest on an outcome. At the same
  time\, the results explicitly account for added flexibility in allowing an
  unknown functional form for the response of the outcome\nto regressor of i
 nterest given confounders. A key condition which makes inference in\nthis s
 etting possible is sparsity\; there is a small (unknown) subset of terms wh
 ich can\nreplace the entire series without inducing significant bias. Rates
  of convergence and\nasymptotic normality are derived for series estimators
  of a component of a conditional\nexpectation in high dimensional models un
 der sparsity conditions. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that the proposed 
 estimator performs favorably in terms of size of tests\nand risk properties
  relative to other estimation strategies.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Financial consequences of seasonal change on mortality\n
 \nAbstract: Changes in mortality rates have a significant impact on financi
 al and pension planning. The pricing of financial\, pension and insurance p
 roducts that are contingent upon survival or death is based on the accurate
  forecasting of mortality rates. Knowledge of future mortality change is th
 erefore very important from a financial point of view as a significant prop
 ortion of the financial markets are driven by pension funds. Seasonal morta
 lity is seen each year around the world\, with a higher number of deaths in
  winter months compared to the summer. For example\, in the United Kingdom\
 , it is well known that government actions\, such as winter fuel allowances
 \, are designed to deal with this issue. Thus\, a fundamental question in t
 he study of mortality rates and seasonality is how the changes in seasonali
 ty impact on mortality rates across the United Kingdom. In our research\, w
 e implement a new factor related to temperature and show this produces a be
 tter fitting and forecasting model. We also show how changes in our environ
 ment could impact on future mortality rates and\, as a consequence\, the pr
 ices of mortality linked insurance and financial products.

 pan></b> Effectively tackling contemporary challenges posed by climate chan
 ge and the continued degradation of natural habitats requires swift and dec
 isive actions. Identifying the most effective policies (or a mix thereof) i
 s crucial to inform policy-makers that are often constrained in their choic
 e set. Traditional methods for policy evaluation rely on precise knowledge 
 about the occurrence and timing of interventions. Structural break identifi
 cation on the other hand has a long tradition in the field of econometrics.
  Recent approaches cast the search for such breaks in the form of indicator
 -saturated regressions\, identifying step-shifts in relevant time series\, 
 but lack a proper framework of uncertainty quantification. We introduce a c
 oherent probabilistic framework for the detection of structural breaks with
  unknown timing in panel data. The proposed Bayesian setup naturally incorp
 orates the quantification of break uncertainty with little overhead. Simula
 tion studies demonstrate that our approach is competitive to existing appro
 aches in detecting true positives and drastically reduces false positives. 
 We apply our method to replicate studies on the effectiveness of climate po
 licies in the European transport sector and provide novel insights in the d
 ynamics of deforestation in the tropics.

DESCRIPTION:TITLE: Structural Inference Using VARMAs with Heteroskedastic E
 rrors\n\nABSTRACT:\nWe show that allowing for time variation in the covaria
 nces of conditionally Gaussian vector autoregressive moving average (VARMA)
  models induces uniqueness in terms of fundamental and various non-fundamen
 tal representations. Hence\, it resolves an important issue in applying mul
 tivariate time series models to structural macroeconomic problems.  At the 
 same time\, heteroskedasticity has been repeatedly identified as an essenti
 al feature of economic time-series data\, so introducing it in VARMA modeli
 ng is a natural extension.  Although computation in this setting is more ch
 allenging\, the conditionally Gaussian nature of the model renders efficien
 t sampling algorithms feasible. We further develop Hamiltonian Monte Carlo 
 (HMC) algorithms for VARMAs with fixed coefficients and various stochastic 
 volatility specifications. Monte Carlo evidence based on DGPs derived from 
 callibrated DSGE models demonstrate that the algorithm performs well in pra
 ctice.  We further employ the algorithm to assess the effect of shock antic
 ipation (or foresight) on inference about impulse response functions.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Modelling cross correlation across major financial marke
 ts: a threshold approach\n\nAbstract: In this paper we propose a parsimonio
 us regime-switching approach to model the correlations between assets\, the
  threshold conditional correlation (TCC) model. This method allows the dyna
 mics of the correlations to change from one state (or regime) to another as
  a function of observable transition variables. Our model is similar in spi
 rit to Silvennoinen and Teräsvirta (2009) but with the appealing feature th
 at is easier to estimate\, particularly in large cross-sections. Estimation
  of the parameters of the TCC involves a grid search maximum likelihood (ML
 ) procedure in which the correlation matrix is positive definite by constru
 ction. The methodology is illustrated by evaluating the behaviour of intern
 ational equities\, government bonds and major exchange rates\, first separa
 tely and then jointly. We also test and allow for different parts in the co
 rrelation matrix to be governed by different transition variables. For this
 \, we estimate a multi-threshold TCC specification. Further\, we evaluate t
 he out-of-sample economic performance of the TCC model against the dynamic 
 conditional correlation (DCC) using the Engle-Colacito (2006) test. The res
 ults show that threshold model generally gives rise to a significant reduct
 ion in portfolio´s variance compared to the DCC\, expect for when correlati
 ons are highly persistent.

DESCRIPTION:<b> Adverse Selection\, Moral Hazard and the Demand for Medigap
  Insurance </b>\n\n<b>Abstract:</b>\nThe size of adverse selection and mora
 l hazard effects in health insurance markets has important policy implicati
 ons. For example\, if adverse selection effects are small while moral hazar
 d effects are large\, conventional remedies for inefficiencies created by a
 dverse selection (e.g.\, mandatory insurance enrolment) may lead to substan
 tial increases in health care spending. Unfortunately\, there is no consens
 us on the magnitudes of adverse selection vs. moral hazard. This paper shed
 s new light on this important topic by studying the US Medigap (supplementa
 l) health insurance market. While both adverse selection and moral hazard e
 ffects of Medigap have been studied separately\, this is the first paper to
  estimate both in a unified econometric framework.Our results suggest there
  is adverse selection into Medigap\, but the effect is small. A one standar
 d deviation increase in expenditure risk raises the probability of insuranc
 e  purchase by 0.055. In contrast\, our estimate of the moral hazard effect
  is much larger. On average\, Medigap coverage increases health care expend
 iture by 24%.

DESCRIPTION:Title:  Identifying the number of factors from singular values 
 of a large sample auto-covariance matrix\n\nAbstract:\nIdentifying the numb
 er of factors in a high-dimensional dynamic factor models has attracted muc
 h attention in recent years and a general solution to the problem is still 
 lacking. A promising ratio estimator based on the singular values of the la
 gged autocovariance matrix has been recently proposed in the literature and
  is shown to have a good performance under some specific assumption on the 
 strength of the factors. In  this paper\, we  propose  a complete theory of
  such sample singular values for both the factor part and the noise part un
 der the large-dimensional scheme where the dimension and the sample size pr
 oportionally grow to infinity. In particular\, we provide the exact descrip
 tion of the phase transition phenomenon that determines whether a factor is
  strong enough to be detected with the observed sample singular values. Bas
 ed on these findings and as a second main contribution of the paper\, we pr
 opose a new estimator of the number of factors which is strongly consistent
  for the detection of all significant factors (which are the only theoretic
 ally detectable ones). In particular\, factors are assumed to have the mini
 mum strength above the phase transition boundary which is of the order of a
  constant\; they are thus not required to grow to infinity together with th
 e dimension (as assumed in most of the existing papers on high-dimensional 
 factor models). Empirical Monte-Carlo study as well as the analysis of stoc
 k returns data attest a very good performance of the proposed estimator. In
  all the tested cases\, the new estimator largely outperforms the existing 
 estimator using the same ratios of singular values.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Quantile Treatment Effects with Two-Sided Measurement Er
 ror\n\nAbstract: This paper considers quantile effects when there is measur
 ement error both in the outcome variable and in a continuous "treatment" va
 riable while allowing for other covariates that are not measured with error
 .  We identify these effects under two key conditions (i) the quantiles of 
 the outcome and the quantile of the treatment are linear in the covariates 
 and (ii) the measurement errors are "classical."  In our framework\, no ins
 truments are required nor are repeated measures\, and we do not need to imp
 ose distributional assumptions on the measurement errors.  We develop two-s
 tep semiparametric estimators of the parameters of interest that are straig
 htforward to implement in practice. We apply our method to study intergener
 ational income mobility.  Using NLSY data on annual income of parents and c
 hildren\, we find that accounting for measurement error tends to decrease e
 stimated intergenerational mobility across several nonlinear measures of in
 tergenerational income mobility.

DESCRIPTION:Title: "Reactive Investment Strategies"\nAbstract\nAsset liabil
 ity management is a key aspect of the operation of all financial\ninstituti
 ons. In this endeavor\, asset allocation is considered the most important\n
 element of investment management. Asset allocation strategies may be\nstati
 c\, and as such are usually assessed under asset models of various degrees\
 nof complexity and sophistication. In recent years attention has turned\nto
  dynamic strategies\, which promise to control risk more effectively.\nIn t
 his paper we present a new class of dynamic asset strategy\, which\nrespond
  to actual events. Hence they are referred to as ‘reactive’ strategies.\nTh
 ey cannot be characterized as a series of specific asset allocations\nover 
 time\, but comprise rules for determining such allocations as the world\nev
 olves. Though they depend on how asset returns and other financial variable
 s\nare modeled\, they are otherwise objective in nature.\n \nThe resulting 
 strategies are optimal\, in the sense that they can be shown\nto outperform
  all other strategies of their type when no asset allocation constraints\na
 re imposed. Where such constraints are imposed\, the strategies may\nbe dem
 onstrated to be almost optimal\, and dramatically more effective than\nstat
 ic strategies.\n \nKeywords: Dynamic asset allocation\; lifecycle investmen

DESCRIPTION:Title: That P-values should be regarded as being like a Birming
 ham screwdriver\, and likelihood ratios should be used instead\n\nAbstract:
 \n\nThe Neyman-Pearson approach to hypothesis testing is an important brick
  in the foundations of the classical approach to statistical inference. I c
 onsider it to be unsatisfactory because most Neyman-Pearson tests between s
 imple hypotheses can be criticised by relevant betting procedures.  Such be
 tting procedures appears to offer a profit margin to a person quoting Fishe
 r-Neyman-Pearson confidence levels but have positive expectation under both
  hypotheses to the person criticising those confidence levels. \n\nA simple
  change to make hypothesis tests more sensible is to add a third region of 
 the sample space where no conclusion is drawn\, while retaining the two com
 monly-used regions where one hypothesis is rejected.  This change leads to 
 the conclusions that likelihood ratios should be used rather than classical
  confidence levels as measures of strength of evidence\; that Wald's sequen
 tial probability ratio test should be modified\; and that for pure hypothes
 is testing\, where there is no defined alternative hypothesis\, tail probab
 ilities should be approximately converted into likelihood ratios and these 
 should be quoted as indicators of statistical significance. \n\nThe practic
 al impact of this alternative approach will be illustrated using two epidem
 iological trials.  The academic impact will be discussed relative to the id
 eas in Kuhn’s book “The Structure of Scientific Revolutions”.\n\n<a href="h

 >Title</b>: Kendall and Spearman Rank Correlations for Skew-Elliptical Copu
 las<br><br><b>Abstract</b>: In this paper\, we derive explicit formulas of 
 Kendall’s tau and Spearman’s rho rank correlations for two general classes 
 of skew-elliptical copulas: normal location-scale mixture copulas and skew-
 normal scale mixture copulas\, which encompass some widely used skew-t and 
 skew-normal copulas. These formulas establish mappings from copula paramete
 rs to rank correlation coeﬃcients\, potentially facilitating robust rank-ba
 sed estimation of skew-elliptical copula models. Additionally\, we investig
 ate and compare the impacts of asymmetry parameters on the properties of bo
 th rank correlations within these two classes of skew-elliptical models. No
 tably\, the introduction of asymmetry in normal location-scale mixture copu
 las restricts the attainable range of the rank correlations from [-1\,1] – 
 as observed under elliptical symmetry – to a strict subset of [-1\,1]. In c
 ontrast\, the entire interval [-1\, 1] remains attainable for skew-normal s
 cale mixture copulas.<br><br>Kind regards<br>Dan\, Ben\, Michael and Klaus

 r><br><b>Title</b>: Locating central shortest paths in graphs and networks<
 /p><p><b>Abstract</b>: In network analysis\, the notion of <b>centrality</b
 > is used to quantify a node's importance to the network's structure. Sever
 al centrality indices that capturecomplementary aspects of a node's positio
 n have been proposed in the literature over the years. One of the most popu
 lar among them is <b>degree centrality</b>. Informally\, <b>degree centrali
 ty</b> of a node is the number of nodes adjacent to it.</p><p>Despite its s
 implicity\, degree centrality can be very revealing. It measures the immedi
 ate reachability of a node. In other words\, a node's importance depends on
  how many other nodes can be reached directly from it. For example\, in a t
 ypical social network\, where each node corresponds to an actor\, and an ed
 ge between two nodes indicates social interaction\, degree centrality captu
 res the size of the social circle of an actor. In sensor and facility locat
 ion applications\, degree centrality captures the number of instantaneously
  reachable or covered nodes.</p><p>In this talk\, we extend the concept of 
 node centrality to centrality of a path in a graph. We focus on degree cent
 rality<b> of the shortest path</b> between two nodes. We show that the numb
 er of shortest paths between two nodes can be exponential in the worst case
 . Nevertheless\, we can find the most degree-central shortest path in polyn
 omial time. We develop efficient algorithms to solve the unweighted and wei
 ghted versions of the most degree-central shortest path problem. We discuss
  algorithm implementations and numerical results.</p><p><b>Speaker Bio</b>:

DESCRIPTION:Title: Estimation of Large Dimensional Factor Models with an Un
 known Number of Breaks\n\nAbstract: We study estimation of a large dimensio
 nal factor model when the factor loadings exhibit an unknown number of chan
 ges over time. In this talk\, I will introduce a novel three-step procedure
  to detect the breaks if any and then identify their locations. In the firs
 t step\, we divide the whole time span into subintervals and fit a conventi
 onal factor model on each interval. In the second step\, we apply the adapt
 ive fused group Lasso to identify intervals containing a break. In the thir
 d step\, we devise a grid search method to estimate the location of the bre
 ak on each identified interval. We show that with probability approaching o
 ne our method can identify the correct number of changes and estimate the b
 reak locations. Simulation studies indicate superb finite sample performanc
 e of our method. We apply our method to investigate Stock and Watson’s (200
 9) U.S. monthly macroeconomic data set.

DESCRIPTION:Title:  Bias-corrected Common Correlated Effects Pooled estimat
 ion in homogeneous dynamic panels\n\nAbstract: \nThis paper extends the Com
 mon Correlated Effects Pooled (CCEP) estimator designed by Pesaran (2006) t
 o dynamic homogeneous models. For static panels\, this estimator is consist
 ent as the number of cross-sections (N) goes to infinity irrespectively of 
 the time series dimension (T). However\, it suffers from a large bias in dy
 namic models when T is fixed (Everaert and De Groote\, 2016). We develop a 
 bias-corrected CCEP estimator based on an asymptotic bias expression that i
 s valid for a multi-factor error structure provided that a sufficient numbe
 r of cross-sectional averages\, and lags thereof\, are added to the model. 
 We show that the resulting CCEPbc estimator is consistent as N tends to inf
 inity\, both for T fixed or T growing large\, and derive its limiting distr
 ibution. Monte Carlo experiments show that our bias correction performs ver
 y well. It is nearly unbiased\, even when T and/or N are small\, and hence 
 offers a strong improvement over the severely biased CCEP estimator. CCEPbc
  is also found to be superior to alternative bias correction methods availa
 ble in the literature in terms of bias\, variance and inference.

DESCRIPTION:Implied Stochastic Volatility Models\n\n(joint work with Chenxu
  Li and Chen Xu Li)\n\n\n\nAbstract: This paper proposes "implied stochasti
 c volatility models" designed to fit option-implied volatility data and imp
 lements a new estimation method for such models. The method is based on exp
 licitly linking observed shape characteristics of the implied volatility su
 rface to the coefficient functions that define the stochastic volatility mo
 del. The method can be applied to estimate a fully flexible nonparametric m
 odel\, or to estimate by GMM any arbitrary parametric stochastic volatility
  model\, affine or not. Empirical evidence based on S&P 500 index option da
 ta show that the method is stable and performs well out-of-sample.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Probabilistic Electric Load Forecasting: Past\, Present 
 and Future\n\nAbstract: Load forecasting is a fundamental business problem 
 established since the inception of the electric power industry. Over the pa
 st 100 plus years\, both research efforts and industry practices in this ar
 ea are primarily focused on point load forecasting. In the recent decade\, 
 due to the increased market competition\, aging infrastructure and renewabl
 e integration requirements\, probabilistic load forecasting is becoming mor
 e and more important to energy systems planning and operations. This talk r
 eviews the probabilistic load forecasting methods and practices in the past
  half a century\, discusses the current research activities reflected by re
 cent scientific papers and the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014\,
  and recommends future research topics.

DESCRIPTION:Forecasting corporate bond returns with a large set of predicto
 rs: A regressed combination approach\n\nAbstract: Using a comprehensive dat
 a set and an array of 27 macroeconomic\, stock and bond predictors\, we fin
 d that corporate bond returns are highly predictable based on a new regress
 ed combination model. The large set of predictors outperforms the tradition
 al predictors substantially\, and their predictability is both statisticall
 y and economically significant. Both stock market and macroeconomic variabl
 es play an important role in forming expected bond returns. Return forecast
 s are closely linked to the evolution of real economy. Corporate bond premi
 a have strong predictive power for business cycle and the primary source of
  this predictive power is from the low-grade bond premium.

DESCRIPTION:Constrained principal components estimation of large approximat
 e factor models\n\nAbstract: Principal components (PC) are fundamentally fe
 asible for the estimation of large factor models because consistency can be
  achieved for any path of the panel dimensions. The PC method is however in
 efficient under cross-sectional dependence with unknown structure. The appr
 oximate factor model of Chamberlain and Rothschild [1983] imposes a bound o
 n the amount of dependence in the error term. This article proposes a const
 rained principal components (Cn-PC) estimator that incorporates this restri
 ction as external information in the PC analysis of the data. This estimato
 r is computationally tractable. It doesn't require estimating large covaria
 nce matrices\, and is obtained as PC of a regularized form of the data cova
 riance matrix. The paper develops a convergence rate for the factor estimat
 es and establishes asymptotic normality. In a Monte Carlo study\, we find t
 hat the Cn-PC estimators have good small sample properties in terms of esti
 mation and forecasting performances when compared to the regular PC and to 
 the generalized PC method (Choi [2012]).

DESCRIPTION:Title: Spatial Chaining in International Comparisons of Prices 
 and Real Incomes\n\nAbstract:\nMultilateral international comparisons of th
 e purchasing power of currencies and\nreal income often use as building blo
 cks bilateral comparisons between all possible\npairs of countries. The sta
 ndard approach in the literature weights all these bilaterals\nequally. One
  problem with this approach is that some bilaterals are typically of lower\
 nquality\, and their inclusion therefore can undermine the integrity of the
  multilateral\ncomparison. Formulating multilateral comparisons as a graph 
 theory problem\, we\nshow how quality can be improved by replacing bilatera
 l comparisons with their\nshortest path spatially chained equivalents. We c
 onsider a few variants on this\napproach\, and illustrate these multilatera
 l methods using data from the 2011 round\nof the International Comparisons 
 Program (ICP). Using some novel bounds criteria\,\nwe demonstrate how spati
 al chaining improves the quality of the overall multilateral\ncomparison. (

 lian labour courts. We isolate two channels through which these effects mat
 erialise: statutory reforms\, which change legal standards\, and strategic 
 appointments\, which change court composition. We analyse the probability o
 f plaintiff success in courts using a panel of 81 judges and 2\,223 judicia
 l decisions between 2001 and 2015. We test for and subsequently exploit the
  randomized matching of labour court judges with unfair dismissal cases. We
  also test for and address the Priest-Klein selection effect\, which is kno
 wn to potentially invalidate the analysis of court trials. We find signific
 ant effects from both channels: judges’ ideological background and changes 
 to legal standards are strong predictors of case outcomes. Furthermore\, we
  find evidence of compensating effects: judges with a progressive backgroun
 d rule more often in favour of dismissed employees if legal reforms adverse
 ly affect their chance of success in court.

 <br>A Rotation approach to subset inference in structural models<br><b></b>
 <br><b>Abstract: </b><br>The paper studies subvector inference in linear mo
 ment condition models\, where nuisance parameters may not be strongly ident
 ified. The existing inference methods such as the plug-in principle and the
  projection approach have low power when the unrestricted parameters are we
 akly identified. We propose a rotation of the parameter space which elimina
 tes the unidentified components of the nuisance parameter vector and preser
 ves the identified ones. As such\, inference for the subset hypothesis of i
 nterest can be drawn uniformly using the conventional plug-in method in the
  transformed model. We then use this result to propose the score\, Lagrange
  multiplier\, and conditional likelihood ratio tests for the subvector hypo
 thesis considered. We show that these tests have correct asymptotic size ov
 er a large class of data distributions\, including heteroskedastic or weakl
 y dependent data generating processes. The proposed tests are also asymptot
 ically similar and unbiased\, thus offering a significant improvement upon 
 existing methods that often deliver uniform size control.

DESCRIPTION:Irrelevant Instrumental Variables\n\nABSTRACT \n\nAn instrument
 al variable (IV) that is uninformative about the conditional mean of the en
 dogenous regressor is said to be irrelevant. However\, such an IV could aff
 ect the conditional distribution of the endogenous regressor\, but these ef
 fects are usually not exploited for the estimation and identification of st
 ructural equations in practice. In this research\, I explore a new regressi
 on technique\, dubbed the Asymmetric Least Squares IV Estimator (ALIVE)\, t
 o extract the information that an IV has on the conditional distribution of
  the endogenous regressor\, then use this information to uncover the linear
  causal effect of this regressor on the outcome of interest. I present simu
 lated evidence on the performance of ALIVE when the IV is invalid\, and sho
 w that ALIVE outperforms the IV estimator even when the IV is valid. I also
  compare ALIVE with two competing estimation approaches for using irrelevan
 t IVs\, the Mean-on-Quantile and the control function approach\, that requi
 re certain priors about the data generating process not required by ALIVE. 
 I show that even if one possesses such additional information\, the competi
 ng approaches that take advantage of it do not outperform ALIVE in simulati
 ons. \n\nhttp://www.adelaide.edu.au/directory/nicholas.sim

DESCRIPTION:Title: Identifying Periods of Financial Stress in Asian Currenc
 ies: The Role of High Frequency Financial Market Data\n\nAbstract: We forma
 lly test that a process containing Brownian motion and jumps characterizes 
 the high frequency observations for eight Asian currencies against the US d
 ollar. By harnessing the changes in behavior of the data during periods of 
 stress we explore evidence for detecting stress dates in the data. We align
  the identified stress dates to economic and political conditions using cen
 tral bank and IMF reports on developments in currency markets. While there 
 is some evidence that liquidity is related to financial stress\, increased 
 liquidity does not often dramatically increase the probability of a stressf
 ul episode.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Identification of SVAR Models by Combining Sign Restrict
 ions With External Instruments\n\nAbstract: \nWe discuss combining sign res
 trictions with information in external instruments (proxy variables) to ide
 ntify structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) models. We distinguish two sc
 enarios that are relevant for SVAR practitioners. In the first\, we assume 
 the availability of valid external instruments. Here\, sign restrictions ca
 n be imposed to identify additional shocks\, or to further disentangle the 
 effects of shocks to be identified by external instruments. In the latter c
 ase\, these restrictions eventually become overidentifying and can be check
 ed against the data. In the second scenario\, we assume the availability of
  proxy variables without assuming their exogeneity. We propose to use knowl
 edge on the relation between proxy variables and the structural shocks to s
 harpen the results from set-identifying sign restrictions. We discuss Bayes
 ian inference and the estimation of marginal likelihoods and Bayes factors\
 , which allows us to check overidentifying restrictions. In empirical appli
 cations we illustrate the usefulness of our method estimating the effects o
 f oil market and monetary policy shocks

  the empirical analysis of singular processes. A strong rationale\, a well-
 developed theoretical framework and\, as we show\, empirical support exist 
 for multivariate time series with a singular spectral density. A singular s
 pectral density is consistent with economic theory underlying\, for example
 \, DSGE models in which the number of variables is greater than the number 
 of structural shocks. This assumption guarantees the existence of a finite 
 order VAR representation but there does not exist a unique probability dens
 ity function with respect to the Lebesgue measure. We therefore define a de
 nsity on a compact submanifold with respect to the Hausdorff measure and\, 
 in a Bayesian framework\, develop an HMC algorithm that jointly samples coe
 fficients\, lag length\, and the number of shocks. We use the proposed fram
 ework to carry out structural analysis on the US macroeconomy with COVID sh
 ocks.<br><br>Kind regards<br>Shanika\, Dan and Bonsoo

DESCRIPTION:Title: Improving Finite Sample Approximation by Central Limit T
 heorems for DEA and FDH efficiency scores\n\nAbstract: We propose an improv
 ement of the finite sample approximation of the central limit theorems (CLT
 s) that were recently derived for statistics involving production efficienc
 y scores estimated via Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) or Free Disposal Hul
 l (FDH) approaches. The improvement is very easy to implement since it invo
 lves a simple correction of the variance estimator with an estimate of the 
 bias of the already \nemployed statistics without any additional computatio
 nal burden and preserves the original asymptotic results such as consistenc
 y and asymptotic normality. The proposed approach persistently showed impro
 vement in all the scenarios that we tried in various Monte-Carlo experiment
 s\, especially for relatively small samples or relatively large dimensions 
 (measured by total number of inputs and outputs) of the underlying producti
 on model. This approach therefore is expected to produce more accurate esti
 mates of confidence intervals of aggregates of individual efficiency scores
  in empirical research using DEA or FDH approaches and so must be valuable 
 for practitioners. We also illustrate this method using a popular agricultu
 ral data set (from International Rice Research Institute) to confirm that t
 he difference in the estimated confidence intervals can be substantial. A s
 tep-by-step implementation algorithm of the proposed approach is included i
 n the Appendix.

 <span><span><span><span><span><span>Abstract: </span></span></span></span><
 /span></span></span></span>This paper develops a new econometric framework 
 for testing and inference on Almost Stochastic Dominance (ASD)\, a relaxati
 on of the classical stochastic dominance concept that allows for small viol
 ations of dominance relations. We propose a joint test of the necessary and
  sufficient conditions for ASD that fully incorporates boundary constraints
  often ignored in the existing literature. Our approach accommodates genera
 l sampling schemes\, including weakly dependent time series\, thereby exten
 ding the applicability of stochastic dominance tests to a wide range of emp
 irical contexts. The proposed procedures are uniformly valid\, unlike conve
 ntional methods based on pointwise asymptotic approximations\, and we furth
 er provide inference for a measure of violation from ASD. We also extend ou
 r results to the estimation of the horizon index and to the concept of Almo
 st Time Stochastic Dominance (ATSD)\, which integrates temporal and risk-ba
 sed dominance. The ASD framework is practically motivated by the need for r
 obust welfare and policy comparisons when exact dominance rarely holds in f
 inite samples or in the presence of measurement noise. By quantifying and t
 esting for economically negligible violations of dominance\, our methods of
 fer a more realistic and informative tool for decision analysis under uncer
 tainty.

DESCRIPTION:Title:  CAT Bond Pricing under a Product Probability Measure wi
 th EVT Risk Characterization\n\nAbstract:  Frequent large losses from recen
 t catastrophes have caused great concerns among insurers/reinsurers\, who t
 hen turn to seek mitigations of such catastrophe risks by issuing catastrop
 he (CAT) bonds and thereby transferring the risks to the bond market. Where
 as\, the pricing of CAT bonds remains a challenging task\, mainly due to th
 e facts that the CAT bond market is incomplete and that the pricing usually
  requires knowledge about the tail of the risks. In this paper\, we propose
  a general pricing framework based on a product pricing measure\, which com
 bines a distorted probability measure that prices the catastrophe risks und
 erlying the CAT bond with a risk-neutral probability measure that prices in
 terest rate risk. We also demonstrate the use of the peaks over threshold (
 POT) method to uncover the tail risk. Finally\, we conduct case studies usi
 ng Mexico and California earthquake data to demonstrate the applicability o
 f our pricing framework. \n\n\n\nThis talk is based on the following paper:

 the real exchange rate in both countries. Additionally\, the expected decli

DESCRIPTION:Determining the co-integrating rank of a system of variables ha
 s become a fundamental aspect of applied research in macroeconomics and fin
 ance. It is wellknown that standard asymptotic likelihood ratio tests for c
 o-integration rank of Johansen (1996) can be unreliable in small samples wi
 th empirical rejection frequencies often very much in excess of the nominal
  level. As a consequence\, bootstrap versions of these tests have been deve
 loped. To be useful\, however\, sequential procedures for determining the c
 o-integrating rank based on these bootstrap tests need to be consistent\, i
 n the sense that the probability of selecting a rank smaller than (equal to
 ) the true co-integrating rank will converge to zero (one minus the margina
 l significance level)\, as the sample size diverges\, for general I(1) proc
 esses. No such likelihood-based procedure is currently known to be availabl
 e. In this paper we fill this gap in the literature by proposing a bootstra
 p sequential algorithm which we demonstrate delivers consistent cointegrati
 on rank estimation for general I(1) processes. Finite sample Monte Carlo si
 mulations show the proposed procedure performs well in practice.<br>\n<a hr

 ;<br>There is no scientific consensus on the fundamental question whether t
 he probability distribution of the human life span has a finite endpoint or
  not and\, if so\, whether this upper limit changes over time. Our study us
 es a unique dataset of the ages at death - in days - of all (about 285\,000
 ) Dutch residents\, born in the Netherlands\, who died in the years 1986-20
 15 at a minimum age of 92 years and is based on extreme value theory\, the 
 coherent approach to research problems of this type. Unlike some other stud
 ies we base our analysis on the configuration of thousands of mortality dat
 a of old people\, not just the few oldest old. We find compelling statistic
 al evidence that there is indeed an upper limit to the life span of men and
  to that of women for all the 30 years we consider and\, moreover\, that th
 ere are no indications of trends in these upper limits over the last 30 yea
 rs\, despite the fact that the number of people reaching high age (say 95 y
 ears) was almost tripling. We also present estimates for the endpoints\, fo
 r the force of mortality at very high age\, and for the so-called persevera
 nce parameter.

 tic properties of marginal-information maximum likelihood estimators for di
 scretely-sampled continuous-time diffusion models with latent factors\, and
  compare them to those of full-information estimators. We seek to quantify 
 the cost of latency\, which we define as the amount of information lost whe
 n a variable is latent instead of observed. We show that the cost of latenc
 y depends on the structure of the model\, specifically whether the latent v
 ariable affects the drift or the diffusion functions. To obtain these resul
 ts\, we employ filtering techniques and develop a new theory of nonlinear c
 ontinuous-time pseudo-filters based on stochastic partial differential equa
 tions. Monte Carlo evidence supports the theoretical findings.<br><br>Kind

DESCRIPTION:Empirical Likelihood Estimation For Infinitely Many Poverty Com
 parisons\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe topic of this paper is constrained empirical li
 kelihood (EL) estimation of two income distributions for data at low levels
  of aggregation. The constraints we consider rank the distributions accordi
 ng to an infinite set of poverty measures\, which is characterized in terms
  of a continuum of unconditional moment inequality conditions. Constrained 
 EL in our setup is a concave semi-infinite programming (SIP) optimization p
 roblem because there is a continuum of inequality constraints\, and a finit
 e number of choice variables. We establish the existence and uniqueness of 
 the estimator for a general class of poverty measures\, and its characteriz
 ation in terms of Lagrange multipliers using SIP methods. The proposed esti
 mator of the distributions is shown to be uniformly convergent in probabili
 ty over the statistical model. The corresponding estimator of the moments i
 s shown to have smaller mean integrated squared error than its unrestricted
  counterpart\, uniformly over the statistical model. We use an exchange com
 putational algorithm for solving SIPs to approximate the constrained EL est
 imator. This algorithm has two fine-tuning parameters which are (1) the num
 ber of constraints that are used\, and (2) a tolerance parameter that contr
 ols the level of the violation of the unused constraints. We give the growt
 h rate of the number of moment inequalities for the uniform consistency of 
 the approximation to the proposed estimator of the continuum of moments\, a
 nd we show that no specific rate of decline of the tolerance parameter is r
 equired for uniform consistency. The uniform rate of convergence of the app
 roximate solution is given as it depends on the two fine-tuning parameters.
  Finally\, we report the results of Monte Carlo experiments.\n\nhttp://sydn

DESCRIPTION:<b>Title: </b>Embedding virtual simulations into statistics cla
 sses to improve student engagement and satisfaction.<br><br><b>Abstract: </
 b>Background: There is currently a deficit of statistical graduates in Aust
 ralia. As of 2011\, only 0.46% of all Australian students graduated with a 
 mathematical or statistical background\, falling well below the OECD averag
 e of 1.19%. Whilst there are several potential reasons for this\, the Offic
 e of the Chief Scientist have suggested that this is due to students (acros
 s primary\, secondary and tertiary levels) finding mathematical and statist
 ics classes boring\, unengaging and impractical. At a tertiary level\, many
  statistics students often find themselves simply provided a data set and a
 sked to analysed the results and interpret the findings. Such tasks sees st
 udents missing out on major components of the Problem Solving Approach\, PS
 A\, (such as plan and collect)\, which results in students not appreciating
  or fully understanding their data.&nbsp\;<br><br>Problem: However\, instru
 ctors do not simply choose to omit specific steps from the PSA\, but rather
 \, because they are limited by ethical and classroom constraints. For examp
 le\, it would be rather unethical for Biostatistics or Epidemiological stud
 ents to collect their own data on infectious diseases\, and thus they would
  simply be provided with pre-collected data.&nbsp\;<br>Method: To overcome 
 the issue of ethical and classroom constraints\, I have attempted to embed 
 virtual simulations into my teaching and assessment tasks. This allows stud
 ents to collect realistic data without violating any ethical and practical 
 barriers presented by real research.&nbsp\;<br>Results and Discussion: Over
 all\, embedding virtual simulations into my teaching and assessment tasks s
 aw an improvement in student attitudes and satisfaction. This presentation 
 will discuss these results and address the implications and limitations of 
 this research.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Selecting (In)Valid Instruments for Instrumental Variabl
 es Estimation\n\nAbstract: A common estimation procedure for identifying th
 e magnitude of causal effects is that of instrumental variables\, where ins
 truments are associated with modifiable risk factors\, but do not have a di
 rect effect on the outcome and are not associated with unobserved confounde
 rs. For example\, in epidemiology\, the principle of Mendelian randomisatio
 n has led to the use of genes as instruments for modifiable risk factors li
 ke weight. An issue with genes is that it is not always known whether the e
 xclusion restriction holds\, i.e. whether they could also have a direct eff
 ect on the outcome. Recent developments in statistics have focused on selec
 tion methods for (in)valid instruments\, like Lasso type methods. We show t
 hat these methods can select the correct instruments when more than 50% of 
 the instruments are valid\, but that weights need to be used for when instr
 ument strengths vary. We also show that conditions for LARS are stricter th
 an that for simple Forward Selection methods.

 -mean regression model with heterogeneous similarity matrices. It not only 
 links the covariance of responses to heterogeneous similarity matrices indu
 ced by auxiliary information\, but also establishes the relationship betwee
 n the mean of responses and covariates. Under this new model setting\, howe
 ver\, the consistency of the covariance estimator based on the standard pro
 file likelihood approach breaks down. Hence\, we propose an adjustment and 
 develop the Z-estimation and unconstrained/constrained ordinary least squar
 es estimation methods. We demonstrate that the resulting estimators are con
 sistent and asymptotically normal. In addition\, we introduce two diagnosti
 c tests to assess the adequacy of the covariance-mean regression model and 
 then obtain their theoretical properties. The proposed estimators and tests
  are illustrated via extensive simulations and a real example study of the 
 stock return comovement in the US stock market.\n\nKey Words: Adjusted prof

DESCRIPTION:Title: Granger causal analysis of VARMA-GARCH models\n\nAbstrac
 t: Recent economic developments have shown the importance of spillover and 
 contagion effects in financial markets. Such effects are not limited to rel
 ations between the levels of financial variables but also impact on the vol
 atility. I investigate Granger causality in conditional mean and conditiona
 l variances of time series. For this purpose a VARMA-GARCH process is used.
  I derive parametric restrictions for the hypothesis of noncausality in con
 ditional variances between two groups of variables\, when there are other v
 ariables in the system  as well. These novel conditions are convenient for 
 the analysis of potentially big systems of economic variables. Such systems
  should be considered in order to avoid the problem of omitted variable bia
 s. Further\, I apply a Bayesian procedure in order to test the restrictions
 . The test avoids the singularity problem that may appear in classical Wald
  tests. Also\, it relaxes the assumption of existence of higher order momen
 ts of the residuals.\n\n\nDr Wozniak has recently joined the Department of

 struments are Weak. \n\nThis talk is based on the two papers (joint with Ja
 mes MacKinnon) uploaded on the V:drive.\n\nAbstract: Economists are often i
 nterested in the coefficient of a single endogenous explanatory variable in
  a linear simultaneous equations model. One way to obtain a confidence set 
 for this coefficient is to invert the Anderson-Rubin test. The "AR confiden
 ce sets" that result have correct coverage under classical assumptions. In 
 this paper\, however\, we show that AR confidence sets also have many undes
 irable properties. Their coverage conditional on quantities that the invest
 igator can observe\, notably the Sargan statistic\, can be far from correct
 . It is well known that they can be unbounded when the instruments are weak
 .  Even when they are bounded\, their length may be very misleading. We arg
 ue that\, at least when the instruments are not so weak that inference is h
 opeless\, it is much better to obtain confidence intervals by bootstrapping
  either the IV or LIML t~statistic on the coefficient of interest in a part
 icular way that we propose.

 tle</b>: (Bayesian) Multivariate Conditional Transformation Models</p><p><b
 >Abstract</b>: While traditional regression analysis has focused on modelli
 ng the conditional expectation E(Y|X = x) of the response variable Y as a f
 unction of a set of covariates X with realizations x\, distributional regre
 ssion models (DRMs) aim at capturing the whole conditional distribution of 
 Y given X = x. Among popular DRMs are transformation models\, which have re
 ceived renewed interest in the statistics and machine learning literature. 
 Transformation models aim at estimating the entire conditional cumulative d
 istribution function (cCDF). Conditional transformation models (CTMs) allow
  the cCDF to depend on the covariates in a flexible way through a so-called
  conditional transformation function h(·|x) ≡ h(·|X = x). Importantly\, CTM
 s shift the focus towards estimating the conditional transformation functio
 n h(·|x) in such a way that the transformed response h(Y|x) follows a stati
 stically convenient\, fully specified target distribution which is independ
 ent of the covariates. This leads to flexible and broadly applicable yet in
 terpretable regression models which implicitly estimate the entire cCDF.  T
 his talk shows how to extend univariate CTMs to multivariate responses. We 
 focus on the likelihood-based approach and outline current research on a Ba
 yesian counterpart. The latter have recently been introduced for univariate
  CTMs (BCTMs) as a B-spline based Bayesian version of most likely transform
 ation models. In contrast to their likelihood-based counterparts\, BCTMs al
 so allow for exact inference on functions of the estimated cCDF in small-sa
 mple settings and control the smoothness of estimated effects via penalizin
 g priors</p><p><b>Speaker Bio</b><span>:</span><i> </i><span>Prof. Nadja Kl

 antification for Regional Climate Projections in North America\n\nAbstract:
 \nOutput from a regional climate model (RCM) can be very-large-to-massive. 
 Running several “flavours” of RCMs for identical time periods only adds to 
 the data size. By modelling the RCM output statistically\, hierarchically\,
  and spatially\, where dimension reduction in the model is a practical impe
 rative\, uncertainties can be quantified. In this talk\, emphasis is placed
  on directly summarising temperature increases by season from the North Ame
 rican Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP). Analogous summa
 ries are given of such increases obtained from predictive spatial distribut
 ions. To illustrate regional projected temperature increases from the fitte
 d hierarchical spatial statistical model\, I feature the predictive distrib
 utions associated with the pixel that contains the National Center for Atmo
 spheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder\, Colorado\, the home of NARCCAP. This r
 esearch is joint with Emily Kang of the University of Cincinnati.\n\n\nBio:

 ntentionally coarsen ratings before public presentation\, for example using
  a discrete badge rather than a continuous rating. We investigate the impac
 t of coarsening empirically in the context of automobile crashworthiness ra
 tings. Specifically\, we estimate a random coefficient model of demand for 
 safety under status quo coarse ratings\, then simulate the outcomes under a
  counterfactual scenario with a novel continuous crashworthiness rating sys
 tem. We find the finer crashworthiness ratings would alter consumer vehicle
  choices and thereby reduce fatalities by about 1.5%. A back of the envelop
 e calculation implies continuous ratings would reduce fatalities in the Uni
 ted States by 375 annually. We then explore whether reduced incentives to p
 rovide crashworthy vehicles under a continuous rating scheme might offset t
 hese benefits. We find that the requisite manufacturer response is implausi
 bly large. We conclude that a continuous rating scheme would save lives.

 se assumptions. Gains from simple and transparent time series models are an

DESCRIPTION:Title: Inference in Partially Identified Heteroskedastic Simult
 aneous Equations Models\n\nAbstract: Identification through heteroskedastic
 ity in heteroskedastic simultaneous equations models (HSEMs) is considered.
  The possibility that heteroskedasticity identifies the structural paramete
 rs only partially is explicitly allowed for. The asymptotic properties of t
 he identified parameters are derived. Moreover\, tests for identification t
 hrough heteroskedasticity are developed and their asymptotic distributions 
 are derived. Monte Carlo simulations are used to explore the small sample p
 roperties of the asymptotically valid methods. Finally\, the approach is ap
 plied to investigate the relation between the extent of economic openness a
 nd inflation.

 nTitle:\nDoes Money Buy Me Love? Testing Alternative Measures of National W
 ellbeing\n\nAbstract:\nMany aggregate measures of wellbeing and sustainabil
 ity exist to guide policy-makers. However\, the power of these aggregate me
 asures to predict objective wellbeing outcomes has received little comparat
 ive testing. We compile and compare a range of aggregate wellbeing measures
  including: material measures (e.g. Gross Domestic Product per capita)\, su
 rveyed measures (e.g. life satisfaction) and composite measures (e.g. Human
  Development Index) covering a range of countries. We test the predictive p
 ower of wellbeing measures for an objective indicator of how people value c
 ountries’ relative attractiveness. The objective indicator is net migration
  over a fifty year timespan\, indicating people’s revealed preference (re)l
 ocation choices. The paper examines relationships amongst cross-country wel
 lbeing and sustainability measures\; and examines how New Zealand compares 
 with other countries according to these measures. Based on models of spatia
 l (dis)equilibrium and migration\, we present tests of the predictive power
  of alternative aggregate measures for international migration outcomes. We
  find that both material and life satisfaction outcomes are important deter
 minants of the choice to migrate.

 tirement savers in the accumulation phase.  First\, we explore the impact o
 f an investor’s perception towards inflation risk on their investment strat
 egy.  We find that mis-specifying inflation risk reduces the expected utili
 ty of the risk averse investors\, and more risk averse investors face large
 r reductions.  For investors who adopt terminal wealth constraints (e.g. mi
 nimum guarantee)\, ignoring inflation results in real wealth not adhering t
 o the real constraints.  The conclusion is that investors ignore inflation 
 at their peril.  </span><span> </span></p><p><u></u></p><p>Secondly\, we co
 mpare the retirement outcomes derived from the risk averse and loss averse 
 utility functions.  We use a numerical dynamic programming approach and a m
 odel that includes ongoing pension contributions to savings\, prohibits sho
 rt-selling and borrowings\, and\, when applicable\, includes wealth constra
 ints. We find that the loss averse utility function\, without wealth constr
 aints\, naturally results in a more favourable retirement income distributi
 on that peaks at the investor's chosen income goal with some level of robus
 tness.  We conclude that the investor can benefit from adopting a loss aver
 sion-derived optimal investment strategy to target a sufficient level of in

DESCRIPTION:“Impact of Prior Choices: Sensitivity Analysis of MCMC inferenc
 e via Posterior Manifolds with Application to Food Price Elasticity Analysi
 s under Expert Priors”\,\n\njoint work with Chun Fung Kwok\, Nhung Nghiem a
 nd Andrés Ramírez-Hassan\n\n\n\nAbstract: Bayesian MCMC analysis typically 
 proceeds with conjugate priors for their mathematical and computational con
 venience. The main prior beliefs are then specified via the hyperparameters
  of these prior distributions. Existing approaches for Bayesian sensitivity
  of these prior choices are generally limited to low-dimensional and local 
 analysis (in a form of derivatives or point evaluations) due to the computa
 tional and analytical complexity of the large (hyper-) parameter spaces. In
  this paper we introduce a computational approach to extend prior sensitivi
 ty analysis of posterior Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference beyond t
 he point-wise and one-dimensional perspective. We exploit results on Gaussi
 an processes to generate and analyse manifolds of posterior measures over s
 ubsets of the hyper-parameter space. And we also draw on recent advances in
  Automatic Differentiation for MCMC local sensitivity analysis to improve t
 he precision of the manifolds in higher-dimensional cases. The manifolds le
 ad to new graphical and numerical measures of robust\, and they help resear
 chers specify and assess the (elicited) prior location and precision parame
 ters. We apply our approach to investigate the prior sensitivity of food pr
 ice elasticity within a popular multivariate demand system using data from 
 a  unique virtual supermarket experiment and expert prior information.

 /b>: Estimation of the individual prediction heuristics and switching behav
 iour in learning-to-forecast experiments<br><br><b>Abstract</b>: We estimat
 e the hidden Markov model of switching between several heuristics on data o
 f the "Learning-to-Forecast" experiments. In these experiments participants
  predict an evolution of the endogenous time series of price of the financi
 al asset. The realised price is a function of the average of the participan
 ts' forecasts. The functional form varies under different treatments. A pec
 uliar feature of these experiments is that the resulting time series may va
 ry qualitatively even under the same treatment: in some cases the convergen
 ce to the fundamental price is observed\, while in other cases the price ex
 hibits volatility and repeated patterns of bubbles and crashes. To explain 
 this variety of outcomes Anufriev and Hommes (2012) propose the Heuristic S
 witching Model where participants follow behavioural prediction heuristics 
 and switch between them on the basis of their past performance.<br><br>In t
 his paper we take Bayesian approach to estimate such a model on the availab
 le data from the previous learning-to-forecast experiments. The observed va
 riable is the individual numerical point forecasts. In the experiment indiv
 iduals may condition their forecasts on the price from the previous rounds 
 displayed on the screen. We assume that the individual point forecasts are 
 generated by certain unobserved behavioural forecasting heuristics (e.g.\, 
 adaptive\, trend-following\, constant\, rational) and that individuals may 
 switch between these heuristics. We parameterise this hidden Markov Model. 
 The probabilities of switching are conditioned on the past performances of 
 the rules. We estimate the parameters of the rules and the probabilities of
  choosing a specific rule by an individual at a given time using block Gibb
 s sampler. We find that individual switching is an important characteristic
 s helping to explain experimental data as opposed to the constrained model 
 without switching. Depending on the treatment (functional form of price det
 ermination) we observed prevalence of different sets of heuristics.

DESCRIPTION:【Title】：Estimating Endogenous Treatment Effect Using High-Dimen
 sional Instruments with an Application to the Olympic Effect\n\n【Abstract】：
 Endogenous treatments are commonly encountered in program evaluations using
  observational data where the selection-on-observables assumption does not 
 hold. In this paper\, we develop a two-stage approach to estimate endogenou
 s treatment effects using high-dimensional instrumental variables. In the f
 irst stage\, instead of using a linear reduced form regression in the conve
 ntional two-stage least squares approach\, we propose a new high-dimensiona
 l logistic reduced form model with the SCAD penalty to approximate the opti
 mal instrument. In the second stage\, we replace the original treatment var
 iable by its estimated propensity score and run a least squares regression 
 to obtain the penalized Logistic-regression Instrumental Variables Estimato
 r (LIVE). We show that the proposed LIVE is root-n consistent to the true a
 verage treatment effect\, asymptotically normal and achieves the semiparame
 tric efficiency bound. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the LIVE ou
 tperforms the traditional TSLS estimator and the post-Lasso estimator for t
 he endogenous treatment effects. Moreover\, in the empirical study\, we inv
 estigate whether the Olympic Games could facilitate the host nation's econo
 mic growth using data from 163 countries. The proposed LIVE estimator shows
  a strong Olympic effect on the host nation's economic growth.

DESCRIPTION:Bootstrapping Impulse Responses of Structural Vector Autoregres
 sive Models with GARCH Residuals\n\nAbstract\nDifferent bootstrap methods a
 nd estimation techniques for inference\nfor structural vector autoregressiv
 e (SVAR) models identied by conditional\nheteroskedasticity are reviewed an
 d compared in a Monte Carlo study.\nThe model is a SVAR model with generali
 zed autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic\n(GARCH) residuals. The boot
 strap methods considered are a\nwild bootstrap\, a moving blocks bootstrap 
 and a GARCH residual based\nbootstrap. Estimation is done by Gaussian maxim
 um likelihood\, a simpli-\ned procedure based on univariate GARCH estimatio
 ns and a method that\ndoes not re-estimate the GARCH parameters in each boo
 tstrap replication.\nIt is found that the computationally most ecient metho
 d is competitive\nwith the computationally more demanding methods and often
  leads to the\nsmallest confidence sets without sacrificing coverage precis

DESCRIPTION:Title: \nNonparametric Stochastic Discount Factor Decomposition
 .\n\nAbstract: \nThis paper introduces new econometric tools to evaluate as
 set pricing models and to study long-term risk and pricing in dynamic Marko
 v environments. The approach is nonparametric in the sense that it does not
  require the researcher to specify the dynamics of the fundamental economic
  variables within a model\, thereby allowing the researcher to remain agnos
 tic about the presence and form of rare disasters\, jumps\, fat tails\, and
  other phenomena. Nonparametric sieve estimators of the principal eigenfunc
 tion\, principal eigenvalue\, long-term yields\, and entropy of the permane
 nt component that are coherent with a calibrated or estimated SDF and data 
 on fundamentals are proposed. Identification\, consistency\, rates of conve
 rgence and asymptotic distribution of the estimators are established under 
 general conditions. These results have wider application to the identificat
 ion and nonparametric  estimation of the positive eigenfunction of an unkno
 wn positive operator. These estimators are applied to investigate U.S. aggr
 egate consumption data in a simple consumption CAPM framework.

DESCRIPTION:ABC methods for Bayesian model choice\n\nApproximate Bayesian c
 omputation (ABC) have become a essential tool for the analysis of complex s
 tochastic models. Having implemented ABC-based model choice in a wide range
  of phylogenetic models in the DIY-ABC software (Cornuet et al.\, 2008)\, w
 e first present theoretical background as to why a generic use of ABC for m
 odel choice is ungrounded\, since it depends on an unknown amount of inform
 ation loss induced by the use of a summary statistic (Robert et al.\, 2011)
 . We then present necessary and sufficient conditions on the summary statis
 tics for ABC based model choice procedure to be consistent\, a solution tha
 t avoids the call to additional empirical verifications of the performances
  of the ABC procedure as those available in DIYABC and advocated in Ratman 
 et al. (2011).

DESCRIPTION:Title: Loss Aversion and Mental Accounting\n \nAbstract: Unders
 tanding how investing on different asset classes affect risk attitudes is c
 ritical for the study of decision-making under risk. A large literature doc
 uments the significant influence of mental accounting in policy-making\, po
 rtfolio management and return aggregation. The findings suggest that indivi
 duals exhibit inconsistent risk appetite across different risk prospect. Us
 ing mutual fund data in the U.S. market\, we estimate fund managers’ prefer
 ence parameters for stock and bond allocations\, respectively. We find sign
 ificant mental accounting between these two assets. Loss aversion are stron
 ger in stocks than bonds if the observed asset allocations are reconciled.

 Title:&nbsp\;</b>The Unit-effect Normalisation in Set-identified Structural
  Vector Autoregressions.’</p><p><b>Abstract:&nbsp\;</b>Structural vector au
 toregressions that are set-identified (e.g. using sign restrictions) are ty
 pically estimated under the normalisation that the structural shocks have u
 nit standard deviation\, in which case the estimated impulse responses are 
 to a standard-deviation shock. However\, impulse responses to a unit shock 
 – a shock that raises a particular variable by one unit – are often more re
 levant\, particularly for policy analysis. For example\, central bankers ar
 e interested in answering questions like ‘what are the effects of a 100&nbs
 p\;basis point increase in the federal funds rate?’ This paper explores the
  extent to which set-identifying restrictions are informative about impulse
  responses to unit shocks. I show that identified sets for these impulse re
 sponses may be unbounded and discuss issues that this raises for conducting
  inference. I explain how to draw useful inferences about impulse responses
  even when the identified sets for these impulse responses are unbounded at
  some values of the reduced-form parameters. I illustrate the empirical rel
 evance of these issues by estimating the macroeconomic effects of a 100&nbs
 p\;basis point shock to the federal funds rate. The results obtained under 
 a rich set of identifying restrictions are broadly consistent with the outp
 ut effects of US monetary policy lying towards the smaller end of the range
  of existing estimates.</p><p><b>&nbsp\;</b></p></td></tr></tbody></table>M

DESCRIPTION:Closed‐form approximations to moment values of an AR(1) model i
 n unit root and stationary cases.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nIt is well‐known that the 
 ordinary least‐squares (OLS) estimator of first‐order autoregressive (AR(1)
 ) models is biased in finite samples. Unfortunately the finite sample  dist
 ributions of such estimators remain unknown. To study its distributional pr
 operties\, the lower  order moments have been explored extensively in both 
 analytical and computational approaches. However\,  most of such studies in
  the analytical approach focus on the first two moments and obtain only a f
 ew terms which are expressed in terms of the sample size and the autoregres
 sive parameter. To the best of our knowledge\, the closed‐form expressions 
 for mean\, variance\, skewness and kurtosis remain unknown. We revisit thes
 e classic problems and are able to obtain analytically simple but accurate 
 closed‐form approximations to the first four moments of the OLS estimator o
 f AR(1) model without intercept. It includes the stationary case where the 
 autoregressive parameter is less than 1 and the unit‐root case. Accuracies 
 of the moment values computed by the closed‐form approximations are compare
 d with those exact values computed by numerical methods. It is found that o
 ur approximations are reasonably accurate for a wide range of sample size a
 nd autoregressive parameter\, with errors less than 0.1% in most of the cas
 es.\n\nhttp://www.fas.nus.edu.sg/ecs/people/profile/ecsatsui.html

DESCRIPTION:Title: "Undesirable Outputs and a Primal Divisia Productivity G
 rowth Index Based on the Directional Output Distance Function"\n\nAbstract:
  We first derive a primal productivity growth index\, which is valid in the
  presence of\nundesirable outputs\, by total differentiation of the directi
 onal output distance function with\nrespect to a time trend. We refer to th
 is index as the Divisia-Luenberger productivity index.\nWe show that this i
 ndex nests the Feng and Serletis (2010) output-distance-function-based\npri
 mal Divisia productivity index as a special case\, and that it is also an a
 pproximation to\nthe Malmquist-Luenberger productivity index\, proposed by 
 Chung et al. (1997). We then\nassess the bias in the conventional productiv
 ity growth indexes. In doing so\, we use the\nFeng and Serletis (2010) inde
 x as a representative of the conventional Divisia productivity\nindexes as 
 it is dual to all the famous Divisia-type productivity/technical change ind
 exes\nin the literature. We also decompose the bias into two components wit
 h one attributed\nto the growth in undesirable outputs and the other to bia
 s in desirable output and input\nweights. Finally\, we investigate producti
 vity growth in 15 OECD countries and find that the\nproductivity growth bia
 s ranges from 5:18% to 35:70%. Moreover\, the bias in productivity\ngrowth 
 changes the ranking of individual countries in terms of productivity growth

DESCRIPTION:In this paper we explored the idea that technologies associated
  with information and communications may have a contribution in reducing pr
 oductive inefficiencies. A stochastic production frontier is simultaneously
  estimated with a technical inefficiency model using a panel of 17 OECD cou
 ntries in the period 1990-2005. Clear evidence is found for a significant I
 CT impact in the reduction of cross country inefficiencies. In particular\,
  the results show that\, on average\, ICT contributed by more than 5% in th
 e increase of technical efficiency across countries and over time. The effi
 ciency estimates indicate that the relatively more efficient countries are 
 Belgium and Netherlands\, followed by the USA. Several south European count
 ries are less efficient and have not yet converged to the efficiency levels
  of the most developed OECD countries.<br>\n<a href="http://www.aueb.gr/pag

DESCRIPTION:Title: Algorithmic Trading\, Market Timing\, and Market Efficie
 ncy\n\n\nAbstract: In recent years large panel data models have been develo
 ped to make full use of the Information content of such datasets. Despite t
 he large number of contributions\, an important issue that is rarely pursue
 d in much of the existing literature concerns the risk of neglecting struct
 ural beaks in the data generating process.  While a substantial literature 
 on structural break analysis exists for univariate time series\, a relative
 ly small number of techniques have been developed for panel data models.  T
 his paper provides a new treatment to deal with the problem of multiple str
 uctural breaks that occur at unknown date points in the panel model paramet
 ers.  Our method is related to the Haar wavelet technique that we adjust ac
 cording to the structure of the explanatory variables in order to detect th
 e change points of the parameters consistently.  We apply the technique to 
 high frequency  securities data to examine the effects of algorithmic tradi
 ng (AT) on standard measures of market quality that proxy for some dimensio
 n of liquidity.  Specifically\, we examine whether AT has time varying effe
 cts on liquidity and discuss asset pricing implications.

 ymmetrically Distributed Variable\n\nAuthors: Ozer Karagedikli (Reserve Ban
 k of New Zealand and CAMA)\, Shaun P. Vahey  (University of Warwick and CAM
 A)\, Elizabeth C. Wakerly (EPS and CAMA) \n\nAbstract: Many studies have fo
 und that combining forecasts improves forecast accuracy. An often-used appr
 oach developed by Granger and Ramanathan (GR\, 1984) utilises a linear-Gaus
 sian regression model to combine point forecasts. This paper generalises th
 eir approach for an asymmetrically distributed target variable. Our copula 
 point forecast combination methodology involves fitting marginal distributi
 ons for the target variable and the individual forecasts being combined\; a
 nd then estimating the correlation parameters capturing linear dependence. 
 If the target variable is Gaussian distributed\, the copula point combinati
 on collapses to the GR combination. We illustrate our methodology with two 
 applications based on macroeconomic variables that are asymmetrically distr
 ibuted. The first application examines real-time forecasts for the Federal 
 Funds rate. The second application considers forecasts for US output growth
 . The copula point combinations outperform the individual forecasts and con
 ventional GR combinations in both applications.

DESCRIPTION:TITLE: Testing for observation-dependent regime switching in mi
 xture autoregressive models\n\nABSTRACT: Testing for regime switching when 
 the regime switching probabilities are specified either as constants (‘mixt
 ure models’) or are governed by a finite-state Markov chain (‘Markov switch
 ing models’) are long-standing problems that have also attracted recent int
 erest. This paper considers testing for regime switching when the regime sw
 itching probabilities are time-varying and depend on observed data (‘observ
 ation-dependent regime switching’). Specifically\, we consider the likeliho
 od ratio test for observation-dependent regime switching in mixture autoreg
 ressive models. The testing problem is highly nonstandard\, involving unide
 ntified nuisance parameters under the null\, parameters on the boundary\, s
 ingular information matrices\, and higher-order approximations of the log-l
 ikelihood. We derive the asymptotic null distribution of the likelihood rat
 io test statistic in a general mixture autoregressive setting using high-le
 vel conditions that allow for various forms of dependence of the regime swi
 tching probabilities on past observations\, and illustrate the theory using
  two particular mixture autoregressive models. The likelihood ratio test ha
 s a nonstandard asymptotic distribution that can easily be simulated\, and 
 Monte Carlo studies show the test to have good finite sample size and power
  properties.

 e and Deforest: The Perverse Incentives of Land Regularization in the Brazi
 lian Amazon<br>Abstract: Threshold rules are a common feature of environmen
 tal regulation\, but they also create incentives for strategic avoidance. W
 e study how landholders respond to such thresholds in Brazil’s Forest Code\
 , which conditions conservation requirements on property size. Using admini
 strative microdata\, we document systematic manipulation of reported proper
 ty sizes\, with a pronounced clustering just below the regulatory cutoff. T
 hese distortions are strongest in high-deforestation frontier regions and a
 re amplified by land titling and regularization programs\, suggesting that 
 overlapping institutions can reinforce rather than mitigate avoidance. We t
 hen show that\, despite widespread manipulation\, properties that remain ab
 ove the threshold exhibit higher forest retention and lower conversion to p
 asture. Taken together\, the results highlight a central tradeoff of size-b
 ased rules: they generate strong incentives to circumvent regulation\, yet 
 still deliver meaningful conservation where obligations bind. More broadly\
 , the findings illustrate how policy thresholds interact with weak property
  registries to shape both compliance and evasion.<br><p dir="ltr"><span>Bio

DESCRIPTION:Civicness Drain\n\n\nMigration may cause not only a brain drain
  but also a civicness drain\, leading to an uncivicness trap. We study this
  possibility using college choices of southern-Italian students classified 
 as Civic if not cheating in a die-roll experiment. Local civicness is the f
 raction of Civic in their high-school class. A civicness drain is observed 
 at high and low local civicness. We explain this finding in a model in whic
 h Civic and Uncivic types balance hope vs. fear of migration outcomes\, tak
 ing into account economic gains\, risk preferences\, and their beliefs abou
 t being considered Civic in the place of destination.

 b>Bayesian analyses combine information represented&nbsp\;by different term
 s in a joint Bayesian model. &nbsp\;When one or more of the terms is misspe
 cified\, it can be&nbsp\;helpful to restrict the use of information from su
 spect model components to modify posterior inference.&nbsp\;&nbsp\;This is 
 called "cutting feedback"\, and both the specification&nbsp\;and computatio
 n of&nbsp\;the posterior for such "cut models'' is challenging.&nbsp\; In t
 his talk the definition of&nbsp\;cut posterior distributions as solutions&n
 bsp\;to constrained optimization problems is considered\, which leads natur
 ally to&nbsp\;optimization-based variational methods&nbsp\;for computation.
 &nbsp\;The proposed methods are faster than existing Markov chain Monte Car
 lo (MCMC) approaches for computing cut posterior&nbsp\;distributions by an 
 order of magnitude.&nbsp\;It is also shown that variational methods allow&n
 bsp\;for the evaluation of computationally intensive conflict checks&nbsp\;
 that can be used to decide whether or not feedback should be cut.&nbsp\;Our
  methods are illustrated in a number of simulated and real examples\, inclu
 ding an application&nbsp\;where recent methodological advances that&nbsp\;c
 ombine variational inference and MCMC within the variational optimization&n

DESCRIPTION:Title: The Realized Rotated BEKK Model\n\nAbstract:\nWe propose
  a multivariate realized GARCH model where the conditional\n\nvariance of d
 aily returns depends on lagged realized measures of\nvolatility computed wi
 th high- frequency data. In turn\, a measurement\nequation contemporaneousl
 y links the realized measures and the\nconditional variance. To greatly red
 uce the number of parameters in\nthe measurement equation\, we use adaptive
  Lasso and the least-angle\nregression algorithm. For the GARCH dynamic of 
 the conditional\nvariance\, we favor a diagonal BEKK structure applied to r
 otated\nvariables. Our empirical results suggest that the use of variable\n
 selection with adaptive Lasso for the measurement equation instead of\nOLS 
 leads to improved out- of-sample forecasting performances.

DESCRIPTION:Title: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Traffic Matrices
 \n\n\nAbstract: There is a large class of network optimisation papers that 
 begin (in subtext) with “And God gives you a traffic matrix”. These matrice
 s form the basic input to the optimisation\, but they are not at all easy t
 o obtain. Today\, it’s possible to measure your Internet traffic with tools
  such as Netflow\, but the traffic matrix requires more than just traffic d
 ata\; it requires a synthesis of traffic +routing + topology\, so it is sti
 ll uncommon to see real instances. This talk will describe the history of e
 xploration of these complex beasts in the Internet\, their measurement\, in
 ference\, and application. And we’ll talk about our most recent work on mod
 elling and synthesis of these using Maximum Entropy methods\, to provide te
 chniques for the research community to use to generate synthetic traffic ma
 trices.\n\nBio: Prof. Matthew Roughan is a Professor in the School of Mathe
 matical Sciences at the University of Adelaide\, in South Australia and a C
 hief Investigator in the ARC Centre of Excellence for Mathematical & Statis
 tical Frontiers (ACEMS).  His research interests range from stochastic mode
 lling to measurement and management of networks like the Internet. He has w
 orked with network operators such as AT&T in the United States\, and equipm
 ent vendors such as Ericsson.

 nes</span></p><p><b>Abstract</b>: <span>Stochastic reserving models used in
  the insurance industry are usually based on an assumed distribution of cla
 im amounts. Despite their popularity\, such models may unavoidably be affec
 ted by the misspecification issue given that it is likely that the underlyi
 ng distribution will be different from that assumed. In this paper\, we inc
 orporate monotone splines to ensure the expected monotonically increasing p
 attern of cumulative development factors (CDFs) to develop a new semi-param
 etric reserving model that does not require a density assumption. To allow 
 the maximum utilization of available information\, we also propose an enhan
 ced sampling approach that greatly increases the size of unbiased CDFs\, pa
 rticularly in later development periods. Based on the enhanced samples\, a 
 bootstrap technique is employed in the estimation of monotone splines\, fro
 m which incurred-but-not-reported (IBNR) reserves and prediction errors can
  be obtained. Associated technical features\, such as the consistency of es
 timator\, are discussed and demonstrated. Our simulation studies suggest th
 at the new model improves the accuracy of IBNR reserving\, compared with a 
 range of classic competing models. A real data analysis produces many consi
 stent findings\, thus supporting the usefulness of the monotone spline mode
 l in actuarial and insurance practice.</span></p><p><b>Speaker Bio</b>:<i>

DESCRIPTION:Title: Neither Public not Private: The Effects of Communal Wate
 r Provision on Child Health in Peru\n\nAbstract: The literature on water pr
 ovision has typically compared the effects of private and mixed public-priv
 ate systems versus public provision\, but has completely ignored alternativ
 e systems such as communal organizations\, which are especially prevalent i
 n developing countries. Using detailed survey data at the household level f
 or the years 2006-2010\, we investigate the effects of communal water provi
 sion on child health in Peru. As the municipalities served by communal orga
 nizations are more likely to have poorer health indicators\, we rely on an 
 instrumental variable strategy to deal with the potential endogeneity probl
 em. Specifically\, we use the administrative urban/rural classification of 
 the smaller population units in which municipalities are divided in Peru. W
 e present direct and indirect evidence that this is a valid instrument. Our
  results show a negative and significant effect of communal water provision
  on diarrhoea and acute malnutrition among children under the age of five. 
 These findings are robust to a number of checks and placebo tests. We also 
 find that communal provision is not associated with higher rates of access 
 to piped water. Rather\, the channel through which communal water system be
 nefits child health seems to be better management and service quality.

 he benefits of rolling window and model averaging. Extending the recent wor
 k on window and model averaging\, we find strong evidence that rolling wind
 ow averaging improves the forecasting performance of both individual models
  and model averaging. The rolling window averaging outperforms ‘optimal’ wi
 ndow forecasts in more than 50% of the times across all rolling windows. In
  addition\, the averaging smoothes out the forecast path\, improves robustn
 ess\, and minimizes problems of potential structural breaks in the forecast
 ing period.

 (joint with Tomohiro Ando)<br></p><p><b>Abstract</b>: This paper investigat
 es a model averaging procedure for the structural regression\, or average s
 tructural\, function in a high-dimensional (possibly nonlinear) instrumenta
 l variable structural regression model. The concern here is with a situatio
 n in which sample size can be far exceeded by the dimensions of both the ve
 ctor of regression function parameters and the associated instrumental vari
 able-based estimating equations. We propose a new model averaging approach 
 based on generalized empirical likelihood as an approximation to the averag
 e structural function in this circumstance which\, unlike many studies\, do
 es not require a sparsity assumption on the true data generating process st
 ructural function parameters. We show that our procedure has an asymptotic 
 optimality property in the sense of achieving the smallest possible loss wi
 th respect to a generalised empirical likelihood loss function. A study of 
 the large sample properties of the generalized empirical likelihood estimat
 or under misspecification is needed to establish the optimality result and\
 , as a result\, a different strategy to that elsewhere must be deployed in 
 the proof. The paper provides results from a set of simulation experiments 
 which illustrate the efficacy of the model-averaging procedure together wit
 h an a application to credit card use for taxi fare payment pre- and post C
 ovid in the New York metropolitan area.<br></p><p><b>Speaker Bio</b><span>:

DESCRIPTION:<b>Title:</b> The Bias in Pseudo-Out-of-Sample-Testing<br><br><
 b>Abstract:</b> This paper links Efron's bootstrap measurement of over-fitt
 ing\, called ``optimism''  (Efron\, 2004)\, with Diebold-Mariano tests (Die
 bold and Mariano\, 1995).  The link is made by rendering out-of-sample test
 s as special cases of cross validation\, and in turn linking cross validati
 on with Efron's optimism.  Using these links\, I demonstrate why popular sa
 mple-splitting applications of Diebold-Mariano tests\, which Diebold calls 
 ``pseudo-out-of-sample-tests''\, are noisy and can be subject to significan
 t bias against good models.  I examine real models that predict equity mark
 et returns\, in which pseudo-out-of-sample-tests appear to be extremely bia
 sed against potentially valuable models.  And I present a simulation study 
 supporting my analytic results.  I propose an adjustment to Diebold-Mariano
  tests\, by incorporating Efron's bootstrap estimate of over-fitting\, that
  may ameliorate the problems.

DESCRIPTION:Title: A Benchmark Approach to Finance\n\nAbstract: This lectur
 e introduces into the benchmark approach\, which provides a generalized fra
 mework for financial market modelling. It allows for a unified treatment of
  derivative pricing\, portfolio optimization and risk management. It extend
 s beyond the classical asset pricing theories\, with significant difference
 s emerging for extreme maturity contracts and risk measures relevant to pen
 sions and insurance. The Law of the Minimal Price will be presented for der
 ivative pricing. A Naïve Diversification Theorem allows forming a proxy for
  the numeraire portfolio. The richer modelling framework of the benchmark a
 pproach leads to the derivation of tractable\, realistic models under the r
 eal world probability measure. It will be explained how the approach differ
 s from the classical risk neutral approach. Examples on long term and extre
 me maturity derivatives demonstrate the important fact that a range of cont
 racts can be less expensively priced and hedged than suggested by classical
  theory.

 impulse response analysis: U.S. government spending multipliers in nonparam
 etric world (with Markku Lanne)<br><br><b>Abstract</b>: We introduce a nonp
 arametric approach based on a nearest-neighbours estimator to computing imp
 ulse response functions. Instead of identifying structural shocks in a vect
 or autoregressive model\, we search for clusters of recurrent patterns of o
 bservations resembling given initial conditions or any hypothetical scenari
 o before and after a shock hits. By comparing the dynamics of the variables
  of interest in these two situations\, we are able to trace out the effects
  of the shock. In an empirical application to U.S. fiscal policy\, we show 
 that the government spending multiplier is moderate\, typically clearly sma
 ller than one\, and at most only weakly dependent on initial macroeconomic 
 conditions\, including the phase of the business cycle.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Modelling Electricity Power Cuts in the UK\n\nAbstract: 
 We consider a compound Poisson model for electricity power cuts. Cuts occur
  at rate $\\lambda$ and we associate with the $i$-th cut a duration $L_i$ a
 nd size $C_i$\, where $L_i$ and $C_i$ are heavy tailed and positively corre
 lated. Development of the model is complicated by the fact that we have no 
 direct observations of $(L_i\, C_i)$. Rather\, if $N$ is the number of powe
 r cuts in a year\, we have observations of $\\sum_{i=1}^N C_iL_i$ and $\\su
 m_{i=1}^N C_i$. This necessitates the use of a parsimonious model for $(L_i
 \, C_i)$\, and we have based ours on the Pareto distribution. To fit the mo
 del we apply kernel density estimation to simulated data to obtain estimate
 s of the likelihood\, which we then maximise using stochastic optimisation.

 er Nibbering<br><br>Title: Robust Non-Gaussian Inference<br><br>Abstract: S
 ystems of equations become identified (up to permutation and sign) if the u
 nderlying structural shocks are independent and if at most one of them is G
 aussian.<br>Unfortunately\, existing inference methods that exploit such no
 n-Gaussian identifying assumptions suffer from size distortions when the tr
 ue shocks are close to Gaussian.<br>To address this weak non-Gaussian probl
 em\, we develop a robust semi-parametric testing approach that yields valid
  confidence intervals regardless of the distance to Gaussianity.<br>We trea
 t the densities of the structural shocks non-parametrically and construct a
 symptotically efficient tests based on the efficient score function.<br>The
  testing approach is applicable for a broad class of simultaneous equations
  models including structural VAR models. &nbsp\;We evaluate the method in a
  large simulation study and an empirical study.
