DESCRIPTION:Title: Uproot: A Software Framework for Behavioral Experiments
 \n\nAbstract: Existing popular software frameworks for conducting behavior
 al experiments—both online and in the lab—suffer from limitations incl
 uding architectural inflexibility and limited feature sets that restrict t
 heir utility. They are closed source or do not encourage outside contribut
 ions. To overcome these restrictions\, we introduce “uproot”: a scalab
 le\, genuinely open-source framework for developing and conducting behavio
 ral experiments. uproot revolutionizes data storage with an append-only lo
 g\, ensuring data persistence and allowing the use of arbitrary data types
 . uproot provides many additional important features for modern experiment
 s. For example\, Likert scales are provided out of the box\, file uploads 
 are possible\, and internal pages can be customized easily. With capabilit
 ies such as page repetition\, random page orderings\, indefinitely repeate
 d sets of pages\, management of individual subjects\, dynamically sized se
 ssions\, and convenient async-first APIs\, uproot overcomes many of the li
 mitations of existing frameworks. Our framework is suited for both small-s
 cale and large-scale studies\, including surveys and experiments in which 
 participants interact with each other. We encourage community-driven devel
 opment.\n\nContact: Mia Tam (mia.tam@unimelb.edu.au)
