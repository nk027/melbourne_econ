DESCRIPTION:Title: Know Your Place -- The Male Breadwinner and Female Home
 maker Norms in Bangladesh\n\nAbstract: Men globally out-earn women\, refl
 ecting not only market frictions but also intra-household social norms tha
 t shape earnings choices. We study how two such norms—the Male Breadwinn
 er Norm (MBN)\, that men should earn more than their wives\, and the Femal
 e Homemaker Norm (FHN)\, which we formally define as the belief that women
  should contribute more to household chores—affect couples’ labor and 
 income decisions in Bangladesh. We develop a lab-in-the-field experiment i
 n which husbands and wives make incentivized choices between paired job bu
 ndles varying in income\, occupational prestige\, and required household c
 hores. These choices reveal each spouse’s willingness to pay (WTP) to co
 mply with or violate each norm. We present pilot results from 20 couples\,
  showing that both men and women forgo earnings to maintain the male-bread
 winner and female-homemaker structure\, and that prestige differences\, no
 t income alone\, drive male-breadwinner compliance. The full study with 1\
 ,200 couples will provide the first experimental estimates of the behavior
 al costs of adhering to intra-household specialization norms.\n\nContact:

DESCRIPTION:Title: Uproot: A Software Framework for Behavioral Experiments
 \n\nAbstract: Existing popular software frameworks for conducting behavior
 al experiments—both online and in the lab—suffer from limitations incl
 uding architectural inflexibility and limited feature sets that restrict t
 heir utility. They are closed source or do not encourage outside contribut
 ions. To overcome these restrictions\, we introduce “uproot”: a scalab
 le\, genuinely open-source framework for developing and conducting behavio
 ral experiments. uproot revolutionizes data storage with an append-only lo
 g\, ensuring data persistence and allowing the use of arbitrary data types
 . uproot provides many additional important features for modern experiment
 s. For example\, Likert scales are provided out of the box\, file uploads 
 are possible\, and internal pages can be customized easily. With capabilit
 ies such as page repetition\, random page orderings\, indefinitely repeate
 d sets of pages\, management of individual subjects\, dynamically sized se
 ssions\, and convenient async-first APIs\, uproot overcomes many of the li
 mitations of existing frameworks. Our framework is suited for both small-s
 cale and large-scale studies\, including surveys and experiments in which 
 participants interact with each other. We encourage community-driven devel
 opment.\n\nContact: Mia Tam (mia.tam@unimelb.edu.au)
